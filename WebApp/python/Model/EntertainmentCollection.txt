Kevin James, Leah Remini React To ‘Kevin Can Wait’ Cancellation
After CBS announced that they would be pulling the plug on the Kevin James comedy Kevin Can Wait after two seasons, fans of the show were disappointed as expected. As for the show’s stars, they may have been bummed that the show is ending, but it didn’t show with their reactions of gratitude and love.


Kevin Can Wait stars James and Leah Remini took to Instagram to give an overwhelming amount of thanks to the cast, crew, and fans of the show.

“I want to say thank you to all the fans for the love and support,” James wrote on an Instagram post with a picture of a hanging Kevin Can Wait jacket. “I was so blessed to be able to work every day with the most amazing cast, crew, writers and support team!”



He added jokingly, “I wouldn’t trade this experience for anything in the world… Okay, maybe a season 3. Love to all.”

His on-screen partner in crime Remini posted a photo of her and James saying: “I want to say thank you to the amazing cast, crew, producers, and the writers of [Kevin Can Wait]. You accepted me with open arms. For me to get to work with [Kevin James] again day in and day out was a Godsend. I laughed everyday, and I will miss that the most.”

Netta Barzilai of Israel wins Eurovision Song Contest
Barzilai, 25, won singing "Toy," written and produced by Doron Medalie and Stav Beger. Barzilai has an "extensive background in music," according to Eurovision's website. She studied music in high school and at Israel's Rimon School of Music.
Barzilai thanked her fans Saturday in a video on Eurovision's Twitter account.
"Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for choosing different. Thank you for choosing daring. I love you, keep that going. Do good to others, be good to yourselves," she said, ending her smiling remarks with, "That's about it, let's party!"
This year's contest was broadcast from Lisbon, Portugal. 
Cyprus took home second place in this year's competition and Austria came in third.
Eurovision is staged by the public broadcasters that are members of the European Broadcasting Union, which stretches from western Europe to the Balkans and Russia -- and also includes Israel.

This is the 63rd year of the competition, according to the contest's website.

'SNL' Cast's Moms Critique Trump Jokes in Mothers Day-Themed Cold Open

 The Saturday Night Live cast opened Saturday's episode with a "special Mother's Day message," in which each member's mom critiqued the NBC show and frequently argued it shouldn't focus so much on President Donald Trump.  "Normally we open this show with a political sketch, which can sometimes be divisive. But since tomorrow is Mother's Day, we're going to focus on something we can all agree on: mothers," Aidy Bryant said to open the segment, with her mom, Georgeanne, by her side. Kenan Thompson's mom appeared next beside her son, telling him, "Kenan, I can't magine this show without you. Like, I actually can't remember when you were on it." She then asked why there were so many Trump jokes. Luke Null's mom told him when she got a chance in front of the camera, "Enough with the Trump jokes." She added, "Why doesn't SNL talk about 'Crooked Hillary'?"  "You should be focusing on Jesus," Chris Redd's mom said, as a substitute for Trump. "Why don't you do Wayne's World anymore?" Beck Bennett's mom asked, referring to a popular sketch. Saturday's SNL was hosted by Amy Schumer and featured a musical performance from country-pop artist Kacey Musgraves. For her second hosting gig on the NBC show, Schumer is promoting her April release I Feel Pretty, while Musgraves has a new record out, Golden Hour.

'Avengers: Infinity War' Star Benedict Cumberbatch Demands Equal Pay for Female Co-Stars

 Avengers: Infinity War star Benedict Cumberbatch is using his meteoric rise in Hollywood to bring attention to an issue all too common in the entertainment industry. Speaking with Radio Times, Cumberbatch revealed that he only plans to take new roles in which his female co-stars make equal pay. “It’s about implementation,” Cumberbatch said. “Equal pay and a place at the table are the central tenets of feminism. Look at your quotas. Ask what women are being paid, and say: ‘If she’s not paid the same as the men, I’m not doing it.’” Cumberbatch went on to explain the makeup of his production company. He and his business partner Adam Ackland are virtually the only two men involved in SunnyMarch. “I’m proud that [friend and business partner] Adam and I are the only men in our production company; our next project is a female story with a female lens about motherhood, in a time of environmental disaster,” Cumberbatch added. “If it’s centered around my name, to get investors, then we can use that attention for a raft of female projects. Half the audience is female. And, in terms of diversity, ‘Black Panther’ is now the third most successful film of all time.” The pay gap in Hollywood received wide exposure after it was revealed Mark Wahlberg had received a substantial amount of more money than co-star Michelle Williams for scheduled reshoots on All The Money in the World. Wahlberg earned over $5 million for his role in the movie while Williams walked away with just $625,000. Outside of his role as Doctor Stephen Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Cumberbatch also stars in Showtime's Patrick Melrose. Marvel Studios' Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War are in theaters now. It will be followed by Ant-Man and the Wasp on July 6, 2018, Captain Marvel on March 8, 2019, the fourth Avengers movie on May 3, 2019, the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming on July 5, 2019, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 in 2020.  of   Copyright 2017 ComicBook.com.

The Blacklist renewed for season 6
 The Blacklist has been renewed for a sixth season, EW has learned. The James Spader- and Megan Boone-starring drama, which will return for 22 episodes, has been averaging 8.8 million viewers and a 1.6 rating in the 18-49 demographic in its fifth season. The news should come as a relief to fans of The Blacklist given that the show was planning to end the season with a game-changing reveal. “Our upcoming season finale is built around a major reveal that’s been closely guarded since the inception of The Blacklist,” EP Jon Bokenkamp recently told EW. “Through the years we’ve alluded to it and built the history surrounding it, so I think ardent fans of the show are going to see the truth snap into focus in a way they haven’t before. Not only is this twist going to blow up the show, but it’s going to change everything we do moving forward.” RELATED: Get the lowdown on the Emmys with EW’s new CHASING EMMY podcast   The Blacklist‘s season 5 finale will air Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET/PT on NBC.

At the 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' news conference, Ron Howard answers the one question on everyone's mind
 Sitting on stage with the cast and writers of "Solo: A Star Wars Story" for a news conference on Saturday, director Ron Howard was finally asked the one thing on everybody's mind. How hard was it for him to find the perfect role for his brother Clint Howard once he took on the film? "It was pretty damn easy," Howard said over the laughter that broke out among those gathered for the early-afternoon event at the Pasadena Convention Center. But the seemingly innocent question also gave Howard the opportunity to address a different elephant in the room: How he came to be the director of "Solo" in the first place. "Solo" made headlines last year when the film's original directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, were let go from their duties due to "creative differences" in June, months after principal photography had already begun. Just two days later it was announced that Howard had officially taken the reins of the standalone "Star Wars" movie. "I did come into ['Solo'] late," Howard acknowledged. "It was a lot of work that Phil and Chris had done. And unfortunately, with creative differences, there was this circumstance where they were not going to carry on. "Within [Lord and Miller's footage] there were a lot of things that were really strong and already worked and we knew we wanted to keep, and other things that hadn't been done yet," Howard continued. "And [there were] other scenes that I was given the opportunity to experiment with and explore." "I sat down with [writers] Larry and Jon [Kasdan] and started talking about this and that. And there was this great scene with L3[-37] and it just sort of came up in conversation that L3 needed somebody to be pissed off at," added Howard, to explain how the role for his brother came into existence. Also on stage with the "Solo" logo as a backdrop were cast members Alden Ehrenreich (Han Solo), Woody Harrelson (Tobias Beckett), Emilia Clarke (Qi'ra), Donald Glover (Lando Calrissian), Thandie Newton (Val), Phoebe Waller-Bridge (L3-37), Paul Bettany (Dryden Vos) and Joonas Suotamo (Chewbacca) and writers Jonathan Kasdan and Lawrence Kasdan. Everybody kept things mostly spoiler-free as they discussed their roles and love for the "Star Wars" universe. "It's really wild. It's really exciting. It's kind of bigger than you can even wrap your head around," Ehrenreich said of stepping into the shoes of Han Solo. "Particularly being in the Millennium Falcon is very, very cool." Ehrenreich also had some good news to share during the conference. Original Han Solo actor Harrison Ford surprised him during an earlier interview to gave "Solo" a positive review. "It's just such a huge deal to have him really genuinely enjoy the film," Ehrenreich said. Perhaps one of the biggest Han Solo fans in the room was writer Lawrence Kasdan, who shared how he was drawn to the character from the first moment he saw him in "A New Hope." "When I first saw Han Solo in the cantina, I immediately sparked to him. He lifted up the whole movie instantly. And I loved the movie," said Kasdan, adding that you can see everything you need to know about him in the few minutes of that scene. "[Han Solo] is the kind of character I have loved always. This is a character who's reckless, who's cynical, doesn't trust anybody. Who's a little bit stupid. I love that. He just does things he shouldn't do," Kasdan said. Glover, who grew up loving the "Star Wars" films and considers them on par with the Bible, explained how playing Lando Calrissian was just something he had to do. "When I heard they were making these, I told my agent, 'If they're making anything with Lando in it, I have to be Lando.' And he was like: 'I hear you. I don't like your odds,' " Glover said. "That was exactly what I needed to hear. I really auditioned like it was the only role I wanted in the world. It really was." A Han Solo origin story, "Solo" also features plenty of characters brand new to the "Star Wars" universe. Among those is Qi'ra, played by Clarke, who is one of the few people who already know Han at the beginning of the film. "She's a pretty mysterious character you need to keep tabs on throughout the movie," said Clarke, before hinting that what viewers don't see on screen about Qi'ra's story is probably just as important as what people do see. Waller-Bridge, who plays new droid L3-37, explained how her character is "a revolutionary." "She's a self-made droid, so she created herself out of parts of other droids. Which sounds kind of frightening when you put it like that," she said. "She turned herself into a unique creature that's kind of taller, stronger, more independent than she originally was. "She has an agenda that's bigger than the sum of her parts. It's great to play a droid with a message," added Waller-Bridge. Of course, every "Star Wars" movie needs a good villain and in "Solo," that villain is played by Bettany. "He's deliciously bad and really OK with it," Bettany said of his character, Dryden Vos. "[He's] just super happy about being evil." "Solo: A Star Wars Story" hits theaters May 25. tracy.brown@latimes.com Twitter: @tracycbrown
Netta Barzilai of Israel Wins Eurovision With a Chicken Dance
 Advertisement Supported by By Annalisa Quinn Denmark featured singing Vikings, Ukraine’s contestant rose from a coffin to play on an enormous flame-wreathed piano, and an Estonian opera singer performed in a gown 26 feet in diameter. But it was the Israeli singer Netta Barzilai who won the Eurovision Song Contest in Lisbon on Saturday with “Toy,” a pop anthem about female independence, accompanied by her signature chicken dance. In a glittery corset and kimono, Ms. Barzilai, 25, took the stage singing, “I’m not your toy, you stupid boy,” interspersing the verses with arm flaps, beatboxing and chicken noises. The song was “influenced by the #MeToo movement,” Ms. Barzilai said in an interview after a semifinal this week. “Look, it’s an amazing time when women are searching for and finding their voices.” Will this be the winning performance of #Eurovision? Watch #TOY by @NettaBarzilai now!#ISR #VOTEISRAEL pic.twitter.com/PM721nkBe2 The contest’s close runner-up was the Greek-Albanian star Eleni Foureira, who represented Cyprus with “Fuego,” a club-friendly pop anthem. “Take a dive into my eyes / Yeah, the eyes of lioness,” sang Ms. Foureira, whipping her hair and twirling in a sequined bodysuit. “Fuego” is about “the power of women,” Ms. Foureira said in an interview before the final. “Nothing can put you down. So you need to just go up and fly, fly, fly,” she added, echoing her song’s lyrics. Cesár Sampson of Austria finished in a surprising third place with his comparatively mellow pop song “Nobody but You.” A carnival of high camp, Eurovision draws some 200 million viewers each year. Most winners do not go on to global fame — notable exceptions are Celine Dion, who represented Switzerland in 1988, and Abba, who sang for Sweden in 1974 — but they can still command a passionate cult following. Winners are determined through a combination of juries and viewer votes, and each competition is hosted in the home country of the previous winner. (Salvador Sobral of Portugal won in 2017 with his ballad “Amar Pelos Dois.”) This year, 43 entrants were whittled down into 26 finalists, who performed at Altice Arena in Lisbon. The contest is open to members of the European Broadcasting Union, which includes countries across Europe as well as Israel and Australia. The evening’s most unexpected moment came when a man rushed onstage and grabbed the microphone from the British singer SuRie, shouting into it briefly before security dragged him off. Graham Norton, the BBC’s on-air commentator, announced that the man was in police custody. Offered the chance to perform again, SuRie declined, according to a statement from a BBC spokeswoman: “SuRie and her team are extremely proud of her performance and have together decided that there is absolutely no reason to perform the song again.” The European Broadcasting Union forbids politically tinged performances, but politics tend to follow the competition nonetheless. Last year, Russia dropped out because of a continuing tensions with the host country, Ukraine. This year, China did not show the contest after a Chinese broadcaster censored the semifinal performance of Ireland’s Ryan O’Shaughnessy, which showed two men dancing with each other to his ballad “Together.” In response, the European Broadcasting Union banned the channel, Mango TV, from broadcasting the second semifinal and final, saying in a statement that the censorship was “not in line” with its “values of universality and inclusivity.” The sound effects in “Toy,” the song that won this year’s contest, have their origins in Ms. Barzilai’s childhood. The beatboxing, she said, came from being bullied: “I was fat, and I was teased, and I had to find my thing.” And the chicken noises represent how bullying is about fear: “Fear of something different. Fear of somebody taking your place.” Ms. Barzilai said she previously felt pressured to perform in the soulful voice of Adele or Aretha Franklin — “to stand as a diva, cover myself with black clothes and spread my arms and sing out of my heart” — because audiences could not imagine a “big, funny pop star.” That is why, she said, “a star of my size looking like me and sounding like me is groundbreaking in Israel.” “I’m so happy,” said Ms. Barzilai as she took the stage after she won. “Thank you so much for accepting differences between us. Thank you for celebrating diversity. Next time in Jerusalem.”   Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS

 Avengers: Infinity War directors Anthony and Joe Russo have confirmed the fates of little-seen Marvel Cinematic Universe characters who didn’t appear in the crossover blockbuster, including characters from The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man: Homecoming and Black Panther. Speaking to Huffington Post, the directing duo opened up about characters who may or may not have — spoilers — survived Thanos’ (Josh Brolin) judgement of the universe, handed down by way of the Infinity Stone-powered Infinity Gauntlet. With all six stones assembled, the alien warmonger completed his mission of balancing the universe by snapping his fingers — with devastating results. Thanos successfully wiped out half of all life in the universe, including most of Earth’s mightiest heroes, with only Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper) being the surviving member of the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers decimated to just Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr). Wakandan general Okoye (Danai Gurira) was spared, but her king, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) wasn't. Nebula (Karen Gillan) survived the snap, but watched helplessly alongside a defeated Iron Man as Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Drax (Dave Bautista), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) were turned to ash. M'Baku (Winston Duke) was confirmed to survive, but the fate of Shuri (Letitia Wright) remains up in the air — as does the fate of retired Avenger Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), who doesn't appear in Infinity War (but is expected to return in Avengers 4). The directors tip-toe around spoilers, but they've now confirmed the fates of fan-favorite supporting characters: The anthropomorphic duck appeared briefly in the post-credits scene in 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy, voiced by Family Guy’s Seth Green. Howard made a second cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, where he’s seen flirting with a woman in the Iron Lotus brothel on Contraxia. The dapper duck “survived,” Joe Russo said. Astrophysicist and astronomer Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) first appeared in 2011’s Thor and again in its 2013 sequel, Thor: The Dark World, currently her last appearance. Thor and Jane became star-crossed lovers, but the relationship ultimately failed, as confirmed by the Asgardian Avenger in Thor: Ragnarok. Jane’s fate was dubbed “too spoilery.” “When we say spoiler, [we mean] potential spoiler,” Anthony Russo said. The Academy Award-winning actress said earlier this year she’s “completely open” to a possible return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Matt Damon made a surprise appearance in Ragnarok when he appeared on Asgard as an actor melodramatically portraying Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor’s trickster half-brother. He “did not survive,” Joe confirmed, a fate sure to please Matt Damon nemesis Jimmy Kimmel. It’s been a decade since Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), daughter of now-United States Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), was seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Betty appeared in just 2008’s The Incredible Hulk, where her relationship with big-brain Bruce Banner (played there by Edward Norton) proved to be a dead end. Banner has since found a sort-of relationship with fellow Avenger Black Widow, but what happened to Tyler’s scientist-slash-professor? “Gone,” Joe said simply.  Alien space buddies Miek and Korg (Taika Waititi) swiftly proved fan-favorites in Ragnarok, becoming loyal allies to a then-displaced Thor. They were last seen in the Thor threequel aboard the Statesman, the Grandmaster ship commandeered to save the Asgardians from extinction, but come Infinity War, the duo are nowhere to be found. That ship is attacked in the earliest moments of Infinity War, with half of its inhabitants slaughtered, but Thor confirms the other half of his people made it to safety. Though they may have survived that initial onslaught, were they wiped out by the snap? “Spoiler,” Joe said. No mention was made of fan-favorite Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), but the director previously confirmed the Asgardian warrior was among those who escaped the Statesman. And what about Wakandan princess and genius inventor Shuri? The young scientist was last seen in Infinity War in her lab, where she attempted in vain to free the Mind Stone from the head of Vision (Paul Bettany). She was forced to try and ward off an attacking Corvus Glaive (Michael James Shaw), who sought the Stone coveted by Thanos. The film left Shuri’s status unknown, but if she survived the snap, she would inherit Wakanda’s throne as queen in light of her brother’s death. Shuri’s fate is a “spoiler,” Joe said. Another Black Panther fan-favorite, War Dog Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o), was not seen or mentioned in Infinity War. So what happened to the globe-trotting spy? The brothers didn’t say if she was annihilated by the snap, explaining only, “She’s on missions,” Joe said. Added Anthony, “Yeah, deep undercover.” And what of Peter Parker’s guy in the chair-slash-best friend, Ned (Jacob Batalon)? The teen had a scene-stealing comedy cameo in Infinity War when he covered for best bro Peter to transform into Spider-Man, but his fate remains in the air. “Spoiler,” said Joe.   Peter Parker’s best friend is a big question mark, but what about his hot aunt? Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) first appeared in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War before reprising her role in 2017’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, where she learned her 15-year-old nephew was a wall-crawling superhero. Was Peter Parker’s unusually attractive aunt wiped out?  May is “safe,” Anthony said. Don't celebrate just yet: with Peter turned to dust, that means Aunt May lost her husband and her nephew in the span of just a couple of years.  And what of valiant warrior Lady Sif (Jamie Alexander), who was off-world in Thor: Ragnarok and was subsequently spared death at the hands of Hela (Cate Blanchett) and Asgard’s destruction? Will she make a triumphant return in Avengers 4 and help save the day? HuffPost reports the Russo brothers confirmed she won’t be involved in the Infinity War sequel. “Gone,” Joe said. At least we have Galaga Guy. No, he's dead too.  Avengers: Infinity War is now playing. Avengers 4 opens May 3, 2019.   of   Copyright 2017 ComicBook.com. All rights reserved.
Kendall Jenner Feels 'Ready' as She Goes Braless in Sheer Dress for Second Time in 24 Hours
 Kendall Jenner is doubling down on freeing the nipple. Just hours after the 22-year-old model made a splash at the Cannes Film Festival by choosing to go braless in a semi-sheer dress, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star dared to do it again. As Jenner walked the red carpet on Saturday ahead of a screening of Girls Of The Sun (Les Filles Du Soleil), she looked glamorous in a tiered, full-length sheer white gown, which she wore with only a pair of nude-colored panties underneath. RELATED: Kendall Jenner Jokes About Her Daring Decision to Step Out Braless in a Sheer Dress: ‘Oops’ While Jenner jokingly implied on Friday that her risqué fashion choice was a wardrobe malfunction, on Saturday, she left no doubt that her braless statement was purposeful. “Ready,” she captioned a selfie, as she prepared to walk the red carpet. Of course, Jenner is no stranger to freeing the nipple. Days before flying to Paris, the reality star bared her nipples while going braless in a demure Elie Saab mini dress at the opening of Longchamp’s Fifth Avenue store in New York City. RELATED: Kendall Jenner Explains Her Pizza Nipples Photo: ‘I Was Having a Really Good Boob Day’ Additionally, the model hasn’t shied away from not wearing a bra on social media. Last February, in a selfie post that has since been taken down, Jenner shared a photo of herself wearing a sheer black shirt with her nipples covered by twinning pairs of pizza emojis, a nod to her DJ/friend group. “I don’t know if you can relate, but I just felt like I was having a really good boob day, lol,” Jenner captioned the pic. “Do you know what I mean?” she asked her Instagram followers. “Your boobs go through phases and on this particular day, I felt like they just looked nice! :).” Added Jenner: “My shirt was see-through, so I took this photo and just texted it to Hailey [Baldwin] and Gigi [Hadid] before I left to meet them and was like, ‘Is this too much?’ They wrote back, ‘It’s kind of a lot, but if you’re into it, go for it!’” RELATED: Kendall Jenner Goes Braless to Close La Perla’s NYFW Show Explaining why she ditches a bra from time to time, Jenner previously revealed it all comes down to one simple fact: She’s comfortable with her body. “I really don’t see what the big deal is with going braless,” Jenner wrote on her website/app in 2017. “I think it’s cool and I really just don’t care! It’s sexy, it’s comfortable and I’m cool with my breasts. That’s it!”
Kirsten Dunst's Baby Name Is Predictably Unique
 Sorry, we couldn't find anything 😔 Looking for sweet cookie recipes, the latest fashion trends and inspo, or a way to up your calligraphy game? We'll help you find something amazing ✨  Kirsten Dunst has a baby boy! The Beguiled star and fiancé Jesse Plemons, who she has reportedly became engaged to in January of 2017, have welcomed their first child together and his name is every bit as unique as we might have expected from the Hollywood couple.   A rep for the actress confirmed the news of the baby’s May 3 birth to ET earlier this week. Thanks to a birth certificate obtained by The Blast, however, we now know the little one’s adorably distinctive moniker.   According to the record, the twosome have named their baby Ennis Howard Plemons. There’s no word about what inspired the Irish title, which means “island,” but our money’s on Plemons’ Northern Irish roots.   The new mommy revealed her pregnancy back in January with a gorgeous spread for Rodarte’s fall/winter 2018 campaign.   She and the Game Night actor have remained relatively private about their lives since then, sharing few details of their pregnancy or wedding plans. “We have a timeline, but that’s private!” she conceded to ET.   Plemons did express his appreciation for his partner back in February, however, gushing, “I feel very fortunate to have someone that keeps some sense of reality. And you know, I’m very lucky. She’s amazing.”   What do you think of Kirsten’s baby name? Share with us over @BritandCo.   (Photos via Matt Winkelmeyer + Nicholas Hunt/Getty)  Proof That The Rock Is a Total Softie    
Blue Bloods finale marked acting debut of JFK's only grandson, Jack Schlossberg
 A lot happened in the Blue Bloods season 8 finale on Friday, one of which you may have missed. A brief scene involving Jamie (Will Estes) and Eddie (Vanessa Ray) speaking with a police officer marked the acting debut of John “Jack” Schlossberg, the only grandson of John F. Kennedy. The 25-year-old appeared as Officer Jack Hammer, and he announced the news on social media prior to the episode’s premiere. “I don’t make the rules, I just pretend to enforce them,” Schlossberg wrote on Instagram. “Cash me tonight on season 8 finale of Blue Bloods my dream come true!! Best show in the entire world.” He also shared photos of himself in costume posing next to mom Caroline Kennedy, Estes and Ray, and Blue Bloods executive producer Kevin Wade. In case you completely missed it, Schlossberg recorded his big moment and posted it to social media. “A line fraught with tension,” he captioned the video. Schlossberg, who’s currently attending Harvard Law, previously made television appearances on the Today show, 60 Minutes, and Global Agenda. Now, he’s one step closer to following in the footsteps of his celebrity idol, Dwayne Johnson. “I am the Rock’s greatest fan,” Schlossberg had told PEOPLE in November. “He’s just like the funniest, best guy,” he added. “And what I really love about him is that he is the hardest worker… I identify with that because I think hard work is very, very important, and so I just think he’s the man.” RELATED: Get the lowdown on the Emmys with EW’s new CHASING EMMY podcast   No word yet on whether Schlossberg has truly been bitten by the acting bug. “I’m inspired by my family’s legacy of public service,” he said last year on Today. “It’s something that I’m very proud of, but I’m still trying to make my own way, figure things out, so stay tuned.”

The set will also be available for purchase on Amazon, and for each one sold, Fortessa will donate to the #WeMovement, providing one person with clean water for life. The couple’s buttercream frosting cake, which will be featured on an episode of Cake Hunters (airing June 25, at 8:30 p.m. on Food Network), was made with four flavors inside including vanilla with goat cheese and strawberry balsamic, organic red velvet, carrot and chocolate hazelnut. While the pair is keeping their honeymoon destination a secret, they can’t wait for the next chapter of their lives. “I’m most looking forward to spending more time together,” says Scott. “We’ve been working so hard for so long, I’m looking forward to making plans to settle down and just enjoy doing nothing once in a while.” Property Brothers: Linda & Drew Say I Do premieres June 2 at 9/8c on TLC.
Lindsey Buckingham Breaks Silence on Fleetwood Mac Firing: ''They Lost Their Perspective''

 Lindsey Buckingham is breaking his silence on the matter of his exit from Fleetwood Mac. Buckingham confirmed on stage that leaving the band of 43 years was not his "choice" just over one month after Rolling Stone reported that the rocker had been "fired" due to a disagreement over an upcoming tour and replaced by Mike Campbell of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers and Neil Finn of Crowded House. While the band has done some talking on the subject, Lindsey has kept mum—until now. "It's been an interesting time on a lot of levels for me personally. Probably some of you know, that for the last three months I have taken leave of my band of 43 years, Fleetwood Mac. This was not something that was my doing or my choice," said the guitarist and singer. He continued, "I think what you would say there were factions that were in the band that had lost their perspective." An audience member yelled out, "Stevie Nicks!" Buckingham responded, "It doesn't really matter. The point is that they lost their perspective...and what that did was to harm—and this is the one thing I am really sad about because the rest of it becomes an opportunity—it harmed the 43-year legacy that we worked so hard to build. And that legacy was really about rising above difficulties in order to fulfill someone's higher truth and one's higher destiny." Fleetwood Mac Drags Lindsey Buckingham After Ousting in Unfiltered Interview Noam Galai/Getty Images Drummer and co-founder Mick Fleetwood told Rolling Stone last month, "Words like 'fired' are ugly references as far as I'm concerned." He continued, "Not to hedge around, but we arrived at the impasse of hitting a brick wall. This was not a happy situation for us in terms of the logistics of a functioning band. To that purpose, we made a decision that we could not go on with him. Majority rules in term of what we need to do as a band and go forward." Buckingham joined Fleetwood Mac in 1974 at the same time with then-girlfriend Stevie Nicks. In 1987, he left before the Tango in the Night tour. He rejoined the group in 1996 and had been active with the supergroup since then.

Why NBC's Decision to Rescue Brooklyn Nine-Nine Makes Business Sense

Cardi B Claps Back at Azealia Banks for 'Illiterate, Untalented' Comments — Then Leaves Social Media
 Cardi B has deleted her Instagram account and gone private on Twitter, but not before clapping back at fellow rapper Azealia Banks. The 25-year-old “Bodak Yellow” songstress — who is expecting a daughter with her fiancé, Migos’ Offset — has left the popular social media networks one day after Banks criticized Cardi B, calling her everything from a “caricature of a black woman” to “an illiterate, untalented rat.” “Two years ago, the conversation surrounding black women’s culture was really reaching an all-time high,” Banks said during a visit to The Breakfast Club on Friday, tipping her hat to Beyoncé’s 2016 album, Lemonade. “There was just this really, really, really intelligent conversation going on nationally and then everything just kind of changed and then it was like Cardi B.” Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox. “I’m just talking about this caricature of a black woman that black women themselves would never be able to get away with,” Cardi B continued. “Like, if my spelling and grammar was that bad, I’d be canceled. If Nicki Minaj spelled like that, we would be ragging on her all day.” In response, Cardi B defended herself in an Instagram comment captured by The Shade Room. “I’m from the hood,” she said. “I speak how I speak. I am how I am. I did not choose to be famous — people choose me. People followed me on Instagram and the people gave me a platform to introduce my talent. I never asked to be an example or a role model. I don’t want to change my ways because I’m famous. That’s what I just mind my business.” “This coming from a woman that bleached her skin but wants to be an advocate?” she continued. “Goodbye. I’m not apologizing or killing myself because of who I am.” That only angered Banks more. “So because I point out that you get away with being the typical caricature of a black woman that society says is wrong … and you respond by calling me unattractive and bringing up skin bleaching to basically make fun of me for not being light skinned?” she wrote in a series of tweets. “You’re illiterate, you’re baby mama 4/5 to [a] man who has women crawling out of the woodworks with kids,” she added, targeting Offset, who has three children from previous relationships. “You’re a real life episode of Maury sis. … The fact that your overall statistic-ness is being merited as success is a clear indication that the suits backing you are using you as a weapon against black women’s consciousness and culture.” But Cardi B seemed to have the last word, writing a scathing message on Instagram, which was saved by PEOPLE before her account disappeared. “A woman who constantly finds joy in belittling black women (Beyoncé, Rihanna, Skai Jackson, Remy Ma), can’t try and stand for them because it’s convenient!” she said. “The difference between me and you, I’ve never pretended to be or represent someone I’m not1 I’ve made it where I am for being myself and staying true to that. I’m not trying to represent nobody but myself.” “You busy trying to be a voice of reason and a representative for women of color when you can’t even reason with yourself. You can’t understand where your insecurities come from and why you’re not happy in your OWN skin so you think because YOU can’t figure your s— out that you can create confusion for me, make me unsure about who I am! I know who I am! A daughter of a Hispanic father and a Caribbean mother and I’m proud of that!” she added. Cardi B addressed the “illiterate” and “caricature” criticisms head-on. “You think because someone uses a lot of big words and long sentences, that makes them smart!? How smart are you if you don’t know that the meaning of illiterate means to not know how to read or write? I can do both, and speak two languages fluently,” she said. “Just because I mix a few words up, forget to use commas or misspell a few words doesn’t make me illiterate and doesn’t make me stupid. And because I laugh a little harder or talk a little louder doesn’t make me a caricature!” She ended her note by sending Banks prayers. “I hope you find your peace in your own heart and reason in your own mind. Pray for your own success before you pray for the downfall of others!’ RELATED VIDEO: Cardi B Says Offset Has Picked Baby’s Name as Rapper Hilariously Reveals ‘How She Got Pregnant’ Cardi B and Banks have previously gone toe-to-toe. Back in September, Banks went on a rant about Cardi B on Twitter, calling the Bronx rapper “a poor man’s Nicki.” Cardi B responded by sharing a video of Banks dancing to “Bodak Yellow” via Instagram, writing, “One of the reasons ‘Bodak Yellow’ went No. 1! Cuz even the HATERS love it!” As for why she deleted her Instagram and went private on Twitter, Cardi B previously shared her take on the platforms, calling social media “the most disgusting place.” “It makes me question humanity and not only on celebs, on other people and situations,” she wrote in a post that was later deleted, E! reported. “I see people on here laughing and getting joy of other people misery. People be wishing for other peoples kids to be taking away from them. Be wishing that people career fail and fall not knowing how they going to provide for their family next. Wishing heartaches and break up on people’s relationships, marriage and homes. Lowering people self-esteem and what ya do it for?”
Inside Lifetime's Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance: 8 Things That Are True (and 5 That Aren't!)
 Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s love story plays out on the small screen in Lifetime’s Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, which premieres on Sunday night. From their first blind date to their cozy kitchen engagement, the TV movie captured many of the couple’s milestone moments — and Parisa Fitz-Henley and Murray Fraser’s uncanny resemblance to the real-life couple is worth a double take! But what was real and what was just for show? Here’s a breakdown of the show’s major plot points. And, it goes without saying, spoilers ahead! True: Prince Charles Took William and Harry to Africa After Their Mother’s Death
                The first scene opens with brothers Prince William and Prince Harry traveling through Africa with their father, Prince Charles, just after Princess Diana’s death. In real life, Charles brought his sons there to escape the glare of the spotlight following their mother’s death on August 30, 1997. It was a formative trip for Harry, who fell in love with Africa during that time. “I first came in 1997, straight after my mum died. My dad told my brother and me to pack our bags — we were going to Africa to get away from it all,” Harry told Town & Country in 2017. “This is where I feel more like myself than anywhere else in the world. I wish I could spend more time in Africa. I have this intense sense of complete relaxation and normality here.” False: Prince Harry Was Deep Into the Party Scene Just Before Meeting Meghan
                While it’s true that he was known as the party prince during his 20s, his partying days were well behind him by the time he met Meghan in 2016. In 2005, Harry’s picture was splashed on front pages around the world showing the then-20-year-old wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party. He made headlines again after naked photos emerged from his strip billiards game in Las Vegas in 2012. But after retiring from the Army in 2015 after 10 years of service, Harry had reformed his wild ways. And he was ready to find love and settle down. “Harry’s drinking days are over,” a source told PEOPLE. “All of his best friends have settled and had children, so he’s had fewer people to go out and play with. He realized he was getting a bit older and that it was time to settle down a little bit.” Adds Duncan Larcombe, a former royals reporter who traveled with Prince Harry throughout much of the early 2000s: “He desperately wanted to get married and be happy. He sees his brother has found that. The fact that Meghan arrived when she did completes it for Harry.”   True: Meghan Took Issue with an Ivory Soap Commercial
                The scene where Meghan was offended by a soap commercial geared towards women rings true. Meghan was inspired to change a TV commercial at the age of 11, after seeing a Procter & Gamble commercial that advertised its Ivory dishwashing soap solely to women. The commercial for the soap struck her as unfair and insensitive when she heard, “women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.” Meghan’s social studies class had been assigned to watch commercials and assess them. The assignment led to a monumental moment for the future royal. Meghan decided to write to the company and asked them to change their slogan from “Women all over America” to “People all over America.” And her efforts paid off. The commercial aired on TV again, this time with the slogan, “People are fighting greasy pots and pans with Ivory care.” About 20 years after seeing the commercial, Meghan gave a speech about the moment at the United Nations, saying, “I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt. It just wasn’t right and something needed to be done. True: Meghan and Harry Were Set Up on a Blind Date
                The newly-engaged couple revealed that they were set up on a blind date in July 2016 and knew very little about each other before they met. “It was definitely a set-up — it was a blind date,” Harry said during the couple’s revealing engagement interview. “It was a blind date for sure.” And as is shown in the movie, Meghan did ask their matchmaker whether Harry was “nice.” “I didn’t know much about him. And so the only thing that I had asked her when said she wanted to set us up was – I had one question, I said, ‘Well, is he nice?’ Because if he wasn’t kind it just didn’t – it didn’t seem like it would make sense,” Meghan said during their interview. True: One of Their First Dates Was a Trip to Botswana
                Unlike what was depicted in the movie, Meghan didn’t spend three days waiting for Harry to call her. In real life, Meghan and Harry’s first date was quickly followed by two back-to-back dates in London, so he was already on speed-dial by that point! But after those initial dates, they did travel together to Botswana. “It was I think about three, maybe four weeks later that I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana,” Harry said of their whirlwind romance. “And we camped out with each other under the stars. She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. So then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to know each other.” False: Will and Kate Cautioned Harry About Dating Meghan
                In the movie, Prince William and Kate Middleton aren’t overly supportive of Harry dating Meghan in the beginning and they express their concern over her background. But Meghan’s future in-laws have always been in the couple’s corner. “She’s been wonderful,” Meghan said of Kate after the couple’s engagement. Harry added: “Amazing, as has William as well, you know, fantastic support.” Meghan, who will be learning on the job, “is funny and serious and extremely hard-working,” a source close to the former Suits star told PEOPLE. “I can imagine Kate will find a great friend in her.” False: Meghan Wasn’t Invited to Pippa Middleton’s Wedding Reception
                While it’s true that Meghan didn’t receive an invite to Pippa’s wedding ceremony, she was invited to the black-tie reception that followed. Following the ceremony, a source told PEOPLE that Harry would travel back to London to pick Meghan up for the wedding reception in Bucklebury. The royal was spotted driving after the post-church Englefield House party. The fact that she did attend the wedding — even if it was the post-church nighttime bash — was yet another sign that the Suits actress and the prince were getting more and more serious. True: A Royal Relative Wore an Offensive Brooch
                While it didn’t happen at Pippa’s wedding as depicted in the movie, a royal relative did wear an offensive brooch to the Queen’s annual Christmas lunch, which was attended by Meghan in December 2017. Princess Michael of Kent, the wife of the Queen’s first cousin, was pictured arriving at Buckingham Palace wearing a brooch on her left shoulder which appeared to be “blackamoor” jewelry, depicting the bust of a black person with a gold crown and colorful crystals. The brooch drew further criticism due to Meghan’s biracial background (her mother is Black and her father is white) — and the fact that Princess Michael chose to wear it on the day Meghan was being introduced to many extended royal family members for the first time. Princess Michael of Kent released a statement following the incident that read: “The brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before. Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offense.” True: Harry and Meghan Wore Matching Bracelets
                Just like in the movie, Harry did give Meghan a bracelet that matched his own. The couple started sporting “his and hers” jewelry early on in their relationship. They were spotted wearing the same blue beaded bracelet on several occasions. Prince Harry reportedly picked up the bracelet during one of his trips to Africa. And the gift rarely left the actress’s wrist! She even posted several photos on her now-deleted Instagram account showing off her sweet trinket. True: Meghan Met the Queen
                During Meghan and Prince Harry’s revealing engagement interview, the couple revealed that the L.A.-born actress had not only met the Queen a couple times already, she also immediately won over her dogs. “It’s incredible,” Meghan said about meeting the Queen. “To be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as Monarch, but with the love he has for her as his grandmother. She’s an incredible woman.” Harry then added: “The corgis took to her straight away. ‘I’ve spent the last 33 years being barked at — this one walks in, absolutely nothing.” And Meghan, who has two dogs herself, replied: “They were laying on my feet during tea!” False: Harry’s Public Statement Led to a Breakup
                While the movie insinuates that Meghan was in the dark about Harry’s rare public statement in November 2016 that confirmed that he was dating the actress and slammed what he called the racist and sexist abuse she had endured since their relationship was revealed, Meghan was most likely fully supportive of that decision. And it didn’t lead to a brief breakup as was depicted in the movie. Since it was such a rare move for a royal family member to release a statement about their private life, Meghan would have been briefed about the statement at length before it was released. False: A Member of Harry’s Inner Circle Tried to Intimidate Meghan
                The character of Annabella, played by Marlie Collins, doesn’t exist in real life. But the royal interloper, who chided Meghan about her TV career, biracial background and even her biological clock, did represent a lot of the criticism the couple was facing when they took their relationship public. True: Meghan’s Ex-Husband Is Producing a Show Based on Her Relationship with Prince Harry
                Trevor Engelson, Meghan’s ex-husband, is producing an as-of-yet-untitled show with a premise that sounds awfully familiar — because it’s based on his own relationship with Meghan, and her relationship with Prince Harry. The description of the show reads: “Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media, is next level,” according to Deadline. The idea came to be during a discussion between Engelson — who also works on FX’s Snowfall — and Dan Farah, another one of the show’s producers, where they imagined what life would have been like if Engelson and Markle had children, and he potentially had to share custody (and all the associated drama) with the royal family. Though the basis of the show was hatched from reality, Deadline does add that, “It should be noted that the comedy is fictional, the lead characters are not based on Markle or Engelson, who have no kids together, and she has had no involvement in the project.” True: Meghan Is Not the First Biracial Royal
                Although it’s doubtful that the Queen showed Meghan a portrait of Queen Charlotte, a biracial royal, during her palace visit, she is, in fact, a real royal. Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was married to King George III and was queen for nearly 60 years, until she died in 1818. She’s the grandmother of Queen Victoria and the great-great-great-great-grandmother of the current Queen Elizabeth. Though she was born in Germany, the daughter of a Duke, Queen Charlotte was directly descended from Margarita de Castro y Sousa, which was the black branch of the Portuguese Royal House. Her racial background wasn’t known to the public when she served as queen. It was only discovered many years after her death, thanks to art historians who studied portraits of Charlotte more closely. Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on Lifetime.
Watch Oprah Winfrey's powerful speech condemning fake news
 Oprah Winfrey began her commencement speech at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism with some “bad news.” “Everything around us, including and in particular the internet and social media, is now being used to erode trust in our institutions, interfere in our elections, and wreak havoc on our infrastructure,” she said. “It hands advertisers a map to our deepest desires, it enables misinformation to run rampant, attention spans to run short, and false stories from phony sites to run circles around major news outlets. We have literally walked into traffic while staring at our phones.” But Winfrey, tapping into that same energy that moved the audience at this year’s Golden Globes, made note of “the good news.” “The good news is there really is a solution,” she said, “and the solution is each and every one of you because you will become the new editorial gatekeepers, an ambitious army of truth-seekers who will arm yourselves with the intelligence and the insight and the facts necessary to strike down deceit. You’re in a position to keep all of those who now disparage real news, you are the ones who are going to keep those people in check. RELATED: Get the lowdown on the Emmys with EW’s new CHASING EMMY podcast   “Why?” she continued. “Because you can push back and you can answer false narratives with real information and you can set the record straight. And you also have the ability to and power to give voice to those who desperately now need to tell their stories and have their stores told.” Winfrey further urged the graduating class to “see through” and “transcend” the “hysteria” of the current political climate. “That is how you overcome the hysteria and that is how you overcome the sniping at one another, the trolling, the mean-spirited partisanship on both sides of the aisle, the divisiveness, the injustices, and the out-and-out hatred. You use it. Use this moment to encourage you, to embolden you, and to literally push you into the rising of your life.” The media mogul joked she was a little hesitant to speak at the commencement because “the rumors from my last big speech have finally died down,” a reference to the chatter of presidential aspirations that she has since debunked. But she still came out and reiterated the importance of voting. “If they go low — thank you, Michelle Obama — we go to the polls,” Winfrey said. “People died for that right. I think about it every time I cast a vote. So don’t let their sacrifice be in vain.” Watch her full 20-minute-long address in the video above.
Cannes Women's March: Cate Blanchett, Ava DuVernay, Patty Jenkins Unite for Change
 The #MeToo movement took center stage at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday, as Cate Blanchett, Marion Cotillard, Patty Jenkins and other female filmmakers and artists gathered together to agitate for better treatment of women in the movie business. There were 82 women in total, a reference to the number of female directors who have climbed the steps of the Palais, the festival’s central theater, since Cannes began celebrating celluloid in 1942. In the same period, 1,866 male directors ascended the same stairs, Blanchett said in a statement, as the women linked their arms in solidarity. The Oscar-winning actress and Cannes jury head was flanked by Kristen Stewart, Marion Cotillard, Ava DuVernay, Léa Seydoux, and Salma Hayek. “Women are not a minority in the world, yet the current state of the industry says otherwise,” Blanchett said. “As women, we all face our own unique challenges, but we stand together on these stairs today as a symbol of our determination and commitment to progress. We are writers, producers, directors, actresses, cinematographers, talent agents, editors, distributors, sales agents and all involved in the cinematic arts.”

Flix Premiere Plots Mini Major Move (EXCLUSIVE)




 After Blanchett spoke, Agnes Varda, the legendary French film director of “Faces Places,” added, “The stairs of our industry must be accessible to all. Let’s climb.” The specter of Harvey Weinstein, the indie film producer who helped spark an industry-wide reckoning after being accused of assaulting or harassing dozens of women, was evoked during a 20-minute gathering that was both solemn and celebratory. Announcers at the demonstration said this new awareness has come about in the wake of “Harvey Day,” calling it “a terrible event” with important consequences. After Blanchett and Varda spoke, the assembled women erupted in cheers. Festival organizers have been criticized for failing to do more to publicly acknowledge the #MeToo and Time’s Up initiatives. They have also been faulted for not promoting more female filmmakers. Only three of the 18 films in competition this year are from female filmmakers — a low number that nevertheless represents Cannes’ best showing since 2011. The march up the steps of the Palais was organized by a new movement called 5050×2020, which calls for more gender equality and diversity in the French film industry. It preceded a gala premiere for “Girls of the Sun,” a Kurdish female freedom-fighters drama from director Eva Husson. “The event is underscoring the fact that there has been an awakening about the need for more gender equality,” said Didar Domheri, the producer of “Girls of the Sun.” “There is a lot of work to do in France compared with the U.S. where similar initiatives have rallied so many people and it’s smart to use the Cannes Film Festival to shine a spotlight on these issues.” Asked about the under-representation of women filmmakers at Cannes, Domheri said more women must be encouraged to submit their films to the festival. 






 The red carpet demonstration wasn’t the only sign that women, despite institutional obstacles, were coming to the fore at Cannes. Saturday will also mark the premiere of “Angel Face,” a drama about a dysfunctional mother (Cotillard) from director Vanessa Filho. Earlier in the day, “355,” a spy thriller with Jessica Chastain, Lupita Nyong’o and Cotillard billed as a sort of feminist James Bond, nabbed a massive $20 million-plus deal for domestic rights from Universal Pictures. It is one of the biggest projects at this year’s festival. But it’s hardly the only female-fronted film looking for backing or distribution. Buyers are also being pitched on a women-led riff on “The Expendables” and a Salma Hayek-headed spinoff to “The Hitman’s Bodyguard.” The focus on women’s rights should extend into the festival’s second week. On Monday, Cannes chief Thierry Fremaux, Directors’ Fortnight head Edouard Waintrop and Critics’ Week head Charles Tesson will take part in a conference hosted by France’s culture minister Françoise Nyssen and the national film board (CNC) president Frédérique Bredin. The debate will bring together feminists and pro-equality movement members, including Time’s Up U.S., Time’s Up U.K., Italy’s Dissenso Comune, Spain’s IMA and Greek Women’s Wave.

 During a performance at the Rolling Loud hip-hop festival in Miami on Friday night, rapper Young Dolph gave $20,000 to two fired baristas. The baristas were fired for playing his 'Get Paid' song at a coffee shop on the Duke University campus. The Memphis rapper on Friday gave the baristas the money after calling them up on stage, according to Revolt TV.  "Now how's that for getting paid?" Young Dolph asked the surprised pair, Revolt TV reported. Our journalism takes a lot of time, effort, and hard work to produce.

Young Dolph flew out the 2 students from Duke University who got fired for playing his music at work and gave them $20,000 on the Rolling Loud stage  pic.twitter.com/95f8sj3rAR  Larry Moneta, Duke University's vice president for student affairs, complained after he heard the song being played and considered some of the lyrics "inappropriate," Indy Week reported. The song includes profanity and the n-word. After leaving the shop, The News & Observer reported that Moneta contacted Duke Dining Services, which oversees the university’s contracts with vendors such as Joe Van Gogh Coffee. Indy Week reported that the pair was then told by the company that “Duke University has instructed us to terminate the employees who were working that day.”  A group of nearly 20 protestors marched into the offices Larry Moneta, Duke’s Vice President for Student Affairs to voice their opposition to the firing of two employees of the Joe Van Gogh coffee shop on the Duke University campus.

Young Dolph was in town for an unofficial CIAA party/concert at Cameo Charlotte nightclub. No one was hurt when several dozen rounds were fired in the 600 block of North Caldwell Street, and bullets hit multiple homes and vehicles indiscriminately.  Three months later, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police charged rapper Blac Youngsta (nee Sammie Benson), 27; Frederick Black, 23; and Antavius Gardner, 20, with six counts each of discharging a weapon into occupied property and felony conspiracy.

'Last Man Standing' Revived by Fox for Season 7
 “Last Man Standing” is back on its feet. Fox Broadcasting has given a series order to a revival of the 20th Century Fox Comedy, which aired on ABC from 2011 to 2017. The multi-camera comedy stars Tim Allen as a man living in a house full of women. The series also starred Nancy Travis, Hector Elizondo, Jonathan Adams, Christoph Sanders, Kaitlyn Dever, Molly Ephraim, Amanda Fuller, Jordan Masterson and Flynn Morrison. Airing on Friday nights, the show was a solid performer for ABC, averaging a 1.2 rating in adults 18-49 and 6.4 million viewers per episode in Live+Same Day. If the show was able to match those numbers, which would be likely given the fan interest in its return, it would rank among Fox’s highest-rated shows. “’Last Man Standing’ ended too soon and the outcry from the fans has been deafening,” said Gary Newman and Dana Walden, Chairmen and CEOs, Fox Television Group. “We’ve wanted to put the show back together since its final taping a year ago, and Tim never gave up hope either. Thanks to its millions of devoted viewers and the irrepressible Tim Allen, we haven’t seen the last of ‘Last Man Standing.’”

'Blacklist' Renewed for Season 6 at NBC






CBS Renews Drama 'Elementary,' Cancels Freshman Comedy '9JKL'




 Created by Jack Burditt, “Last Man Standing” had been the subject of revival speculation since it was canceled by ABC last year. Despite the show’s solid ratings, ABC balked at the rising costs typical of an aging sitcom — particularly one owned by a rival studio. Speaking ahead of her network’s upfront presentation last year, ABC entertainment president Channing Dungey denied that that the cancellation of the show was motivated by the personal politics of Allen, who is a Republican supporter of President Donald Trump. On Thursday, in a move that many perceived as designed to clear schedule space for “Last Man Standing,” Fox canceled veteran comedies “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” “Last Man on Earth,” and “The Mick.” “Excited?” said Allen. “Team ‘LMS’ was in the sixth inning, ahead by four runs, stands were packed and then for no reason, they call off the game. It leaves you sitting in the dugout, holding a bat and puzzled. Now we get the news from Fox that it’s time to get back out on that diamond – hell yes, I’m excited! When I heard the offer to create more episodes of ‘Last Man Standing,’ I did a fist pump so hard I threw my back out. It’s the fans! I could not be more grateful for the fans who wrote petitions and kept up the passion and incredible support for the show. And a fist pump, ouch, for Dana Walden and Gary Newman at Fox for not only listening to the fans, but for making the bold move to bring ‘Last Man Standing’ back. I’m sure audiences will be curious to see what we look like after all these years. Oh, has it only been one year? Well, just goes to show you – a lot can happen in a year.” RELATED CONTENT: “Last Man Standing” is back on its feet.

'SNL' Gives 'The Handmaid's Tale' A 'Sex And The City' Twist
 Sex and the City was an escapist fantasy where life was one long brunch date with the girls. But that was a long time ago (the final episode aired in 2004 — let’s pretend the movies, particularly the sequel, never happened). These days, there’s no escaping real life. Even our most acclaimed television shows, which used to be fun distractions, are “so brutal,” at least according to SNL‘s parody of The Handmaid’s Tale. But hey, at least it’s “more uplifting than the news.” During tonight’s episode hosted by I Feel Pretty star Amy Schumer, Hulu’s Outstanding Drama Series-winning dystopian drama was given a Sex and the City twist. The shows have more in common than you might imagine: they both have a female-led cast (Peggy Olson and Carrie Bradshaw would not be friends) and rely on internal monologues. Except instead of talking about kicking last night’s fling out of the apartment, the ladies in “Handmaids In the City” discuss, “Under His Eye? What about under my eye! Look at these bags!” And when Kate McKinnon’s portrayal of one-eyed Janine (played on Handmaid’s by Madeline Brewer) mentions that she slept with a married couple, Schumer replies, “Three-way? How about a one-way ticket out of here?” This could be you and your friends, y’know, “the way things are going.” Coming up this season on Handmaids in the City… #SNL pic.twitter.com/dTqlMEQ7yp — Saturday Night Live – SNL (@nbcsnl) May 13, 2018    
'Saturday Night Live' Cast Members' Moms Weigh in on Show's Portrayal of Politics (Watch)
 “Saturday Night Live” opened its penultimate episode of the 43rd season with a special message for and from mothers on the eve of Mother’s Day instead of its usual political satire. Cast members introduced their mothers to the audience, standing side by side on stage. But soon enough, the talk turned to Trump anyway. Kenan Thompson’s mother noted that she likes the show, “except for all of the political stuff.” “We get it!” she said. After Mikey Day reminded his mother he was in a production of “The Crucible,” she replied that such a story is “a lot like the witch hunt against President Trump.” Luke Nell’s mother followed suit, advising him “enough with the Trump jokes.” It didn’t seem to matter that he reminded her he doesn’t write them, as she continued, “And why doesn’t ‘SNL’ ever talk about crooked Hillary!?” 






 “I’m so new here, please do not do this to me,” he replied. Chris Redd asked his mother not to do it to him, either, but she had bigger fish to fry than issues over politics. “I don’t understand why everyone’s focused on Trump at all when you should be focused on Jesus,” she said.

 “Jesus isn’t president, Mom,” he pointed out. “And that’s the problem!” she said. Colin Jost’s mother said she thinks Alec Baldwin does a great Trump impression but thinks it is too mean. “Who writes that stuff?” she asked, to which Josh pointed the blame at Michael Che. Mothers were the hot topic of the episode overall, with episode host Amy Schumer speaking to them directly during her monologue stand-up routine. In it, she asked moms to raise boys a little nicer, pointing out how if a boy knocked books out of girls’ hands or pushed them down, the girls used to be told the boys liked them. The first sketch after the monologue was a game show ala “The Newlywed Game” but featuring mother-children contestants. Kate McKinnon and Mikey played a mother-son duo with a too close relationship, talking about how they slept in the same bed and how her greatest fear was that he’d meet a woman and get married some day. Later in the episode, a digital short looked at the truth of childbirth compared to the sugarcoated version of the story moms tell their children. And Melissa McCarthy popped by as the proudest stepmom in the world. Meanwhile, the political talk was mostly contained to “Weekend Update,” with Jost talking about Trump helping secure the prisoners from North Korea, saying that he was having a good week because he didn’t even say “Wait, I thought they were Americans” when greeting them and that although Trump claimed to have the highest 3 a.m. ratings over such an event, the actual highest ratings at that time came on election night “from liberals hoping they were being pranked.” “Sure, this is a decent week for Trump,” conceded Che. “The same way a decent date with R. Kelly is to go home dry.” “Weekend Update” also discussed the week’s news about Michael Cohen, the Iran deal, Rudy Giuliani and Melania Trump’s “Be Best” campaign.

Mac exit was not my choice: Buckingham
 Singer/guitarist Lindsey Buckingham has spoken about his axing from Fleetwood Mac for the first time at a California campaign fundraiser. Lindsey Buckingham has described his departure from Fleetwood Mac as "not my doing or my choice". The band announced in April that they would tour without the musician, who wrote and sang on some of their biggest hits, including Go Your Own Way and Tusk. Buckingham had been a member since he joined the group in 1974 with his then-girlfriend Stevie Nicks. During a set at a campaign fundraiser for Democratic congressional candidate Mike Levin in Los Angeles, Buckingham was filmed speaking about his firing. In the video, which was shared on YouTube and Twitter, he said: "It&apos;s been an interesting time on a lot of levels. "For me, personally, probably some of you know that for the last three months I have sadly taken leave of my band of 43 years, Fleetwood Mac. "This was not something that was really my doing or my choice. "I think what you would say is that there were factions within the band that had lost their perspective." He added: " What that did was to harm - and this is the only thing I&apos;m really sad about, the rest of it becomes an opportunity - it harmed the 43-year legacy that we had worked so hard to build. "That legacy was really about rising above difficulties in order to fulfil one&apos;s higher truth and one&apos;s higher destiny." Buckingham also spoke about a "loss of perspective" in Washington, saying: "The loss of perspective we see now is indeed threatening to harm the legacy that is the United States. "In the context of that you&apos;ve got to think of what needs to be done. "It is not going come from the top down, it is going come from the ground up. This is why we are here. "And so, I am most honoured and most pleased to have been asked in my own small way to help in that pushback which very, very much needs to happen in order to continue the legacy that we all have come to value." The group will tour this autumn with Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers&apos; guitarist Mike Campbell and Crowded House frontman Neil Finn.

Bella Hadid and The Weeknd Let Loose at Cannes Film Festival 1 Day After Kissing
 Bella Hadid and The Weeknd seem to be having a great time together at the Cannes Film Festival. Although the 21-year-old model was seen arriving at Friday’s screening of Chinese drama Ash is the Purest White alone, a fan account posted a photograph that appeared to show Hadid smiling while the pair enjoyed some time together inside the movie theater. Just one day earlier, Hadid and the singer, 28, were spotted sharing a kiss at an afterparty in Cannes, France. RELATED: Bella Hadid and The Weeknd Kiss at the Cannes Film Festival After Denying They’re Back Together Although neither Hadid nor The Weeknd shared photographs of their time together on social media, they both documented their night out in France. Alongside a picture of herself walking the red carpet in a strapless custom Dior gown, the model wrote, “What a powerful movie… #ashisthepurestwhite.” She also added that she was “so in awe of you #ZhaoTao,” referencing the film’s lead actress. The singer also shared a photograph of himself hanging out inside the theater. “Honestly just tryna watch movies,” he captioned the shot. The pair, who split in November 2016, were previously photographed kissing on Thursday night, less than a month after they both shot down rumors that they were dating again. In the photographs, the stars are seen in deep in conversation, with Hadid leaning in to whisper something in the singer’s ear, seemingly ignoring the partygoers around them. The two arrived separately at the Magnum x Alexander Wang party but quickly huddled together for the rest of the night in the VIP area, according to the Los Angeles Times. RELATED: Back On? The Weeknd and Ex-Girlfriend Bella Hadid Pack on PDA at Coachella Party The model and singer were also spotted packing on the PDA last month at Poppy nightclub’s Coachella pop-up during weekend one of the desert festival. An onlooker told PEOPLE, “The Weeknd and Bella were sitting on each other’s laps and all over each other all night long. They definitely looked like they were fully back together.” Hadid went on to cheekily deny a report that said the pair were “kissing all night,” writing on Instagram, “It wasn’t me.” RELATED VIDEO: Fans Think The Weeknd’s New Albums Is Filled with Songs About Exes Selena Gomez and Bella Hadid Although the pair broke up in 2016, The Weeknd’s new album, My Dear Melancholy, appears to have been partially inspired by the heartbreak he experienced in the aftermath of his relationship with Hadid. In “Wasted Times,” he brings up imagery of a girl who was an “equestrian” — likely referencing Hadid, who was forced to give up on her dreams of competing in the 2016 Olympics in the equestrian shows because of her Lyme disease. He also seemingly made references to his other ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez, whom he dated for 10 months after parting ways with Hadid, in songs “Call Out My Name” and “Privilege.”
John F. Kennedy's Only Grandson, Jack Schlossberg, Makes His Acting Debut on Blue Bloods
 John F. Kennedy‘s only grandson just landed his first big acting gig. John “Jack” Schlossberg appears in the season eight finale of the CBS crime drama series Friday night as Officer Jack Hammer, and the 25-year-old couldn’t help but share the exciting news on social media. “I don’t make the rules, I just pretend to enforce them — Cash me tonight on season 8 finale of Blue Bloods my dream come true!! Best show in the entire world,” the late president’s grandson captioned a photo of him in a cop uniform standing with mom Caroline Kennedy along with Blue Bloods stars Will Estes and Vanessa Ray, as well as, executive producer, Kevin Wade. In a separate post, Schlossberg, who’s still dressed in his police outfit for the show, is seen pointing at a sign that reads “Officer Jack Hammer.” In November, Schlossberg opened up to PEOPLE about his favorite celebrity, and it’s none other than Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. “I am the Rock’s greatest fan,” Schlossberg said at the time, adding that when Johnson sent him a surprise birthday greeting via social media — a friend set it up — “it was the happiest I’ve probably ever been.” “He’s just like the funniest, best guy,” Schlossberg gushed. “And what I really love about him is that he is the hardest worker… I identify with that because I think hard work is very, very important, and so I just think he’s the man.” Schlossberg, who is currently attending Harvard Law appears to be following in his famous family’s footsteps. Last May, the Yale graduate made his first live TV appearance on Today alongside his mother, Caroline. “I’m inspired by my family’s legacy of public service. It’s something that I’m very proud of,” Schlossberg said about a potential future in politics. He continued: “But I’m still trying to make my own way and figure things out. So stay tuned — I don’t know what I’m going to do.” RELATED: JFK’s Grandson Jack Schlossberg Talks Climate Change and Why He’s The Rock’s ‘Greatest Fan’ Also in May of last year, Schlossberg and his mom introduced former President Barack Obama at the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation’s dinner gala, where Obama was honored with the annual Profile in Courage Award. While introducing the 44th president Schlossberg likened the impact that Obama had on him with the influence his grandfather, JFK, had on the country. “Throughout his presidency, my grandfather made it clear that he alone could fix nothing; that he alone had no answers,” Schlossberg said at the time. “He had the courage to plainly admit America’s shortcomings, to then lay out bold plans to address those problems and to ask his fellow Americans for help in solving them … he inspired a generation to enter public service and to ask what they could do for their country.” He continued: “President Barack Obama inspired me in the same way. My life changed in 2008 because a young candidate was fired up and ready to go, and he told me `yes we can.’”
