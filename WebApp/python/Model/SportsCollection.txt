Looff Carrousel turns again, bringing history full circle
Before Spokane Mayor Dave Condon cut the ribbon Saturday to signal the re-opening of the revamped Looff Carrousel, hundreds of post-Junior Lilac Parade patrons strolling through Riverfront Park were given a quick history lesson.

On a jumbo screen near the carousel, a short video clicked through highlights in the cityís history. ìItís your turn to take a ride back into Spokane history,î said Spokane Parks President Leroy Eadie, speaking from the screen. 

The carousel is indeed one of Spokaneís older artifacts, having arrived in Spokane in 1909, retired mid-century only to be brought back in wake of Expo ë74. Now, housed in a new $7 million glass rotunda, it is a highlight of the development recently opened on Riverfront Park. 

About 140 carrousels still exist in the world, Eadie said. Very few ñ Spokaneís among them ñ are the original, genuine article. 

In the interim since the carouselís closure last year, the horses and pillars have been repainted and refurbished, a feature that impressed carousel expert and consultant Bette Largent.

ìThis is one of the best openings Iíve seen,î Largent told the crowd. ìSpokane has set a precedent for carrousels,î

Hundreds rode the steeds Saturday, the sunny skies and nearby festivities boosting the opening. Rides cost $2. 

The Looff Carrousel features 54 horses, two Chinese Dragon chairs, a giraffe, a tiger, and a brass ring to catch.

ìThis has been a special place with memories for thousands of people in the Spokane area, including myselfî Condon said. ìAnd that will continue.î
Trail blazed: Brooke Olzendam found her calling on the hardwood. Now sheís living out her dream
PORTLAND ñ It may have been all the hours Brooke Olzendam spent trailing her father around the basketball gym in Medical Lake. Or the posters attached to the walls of her bedroom ñ David Robinson, Gary Payton and Clyde Drexler were never too far away when Olzendam tucked in to go to sleep. Or it couldíve been all those years hoisting jumpers on baskets around town, on the cool hardwood of Shadle Park High, or the toasty asphalt of Spokaneís world-famous 3-on-3 tournament.

No matter how it happened, Olzendam discovered her calling at a young age ñ and she discovered it in Spokane. 

ìAs soon as I could literally hold a basketball,î she said, ìIím sure I was holding it.î

From the underbelly of Portlandís Moda Center, where sheís logged two years as a sideline reporter for the NBAís Portland Trail Blazers, Olzendam describes her affinity for the game, dishing out a major assist to the city that helped define it.

ìEverywhere you looked, youíre watching Zags, youíre going to Hoopfest or I was going to my dadís games,î she said. ìPlaying basketball, 24/7.î

Olzendamís last name might ring familiar to Spokaneites ñ not necessarily because thereís an overwhelming population of Blazer fans in the Inland Northwest, but because her father is an accomplished high school basketball coach who spent a significant portion of his 31-year career winning big time at Medical Lake.

Dave Olzendam, a Washington Interscholastic Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame inductee, compiled a record of 430-303 during stints with Medical Lake, Rochester, Coulee-Hartline and Interlake. Dave led two decades of greatness at Medical Lake, finishing runner-up in the 1995 state tournament before leaving the school with a 286-197 mark.

His hoops-starved daughter often took the backseat when the family made cross-state pilgrimages to the Tacoma Dome for the state tournament.

ìThe big dream for me was, dad would make the state tournament and I got to go to Tacoma, we got to stay at the La Quinta Inn and they had a pool,î Olzendam said. ìAnd that was like the best thing in the world, better than Christmas.î

The details are fuzzy, but Dave Olzendam recalls one particular state play-in game. 

ìI forget who we were playing, but it was coming down to the bitter end,î he said, ìthe last 30 seconds and she actually went over to an auxiliary gym, got down on our hands and knees and prayed to God that we won so she could go to the state tournament.î

ìSo basketball was life for me,î Brooke said, ìthatís all I know.î

ó-

Like virtually everyone else in town, Olzendam and her parents grew up Gonzaga fanatics, but her mother, aunt and uncle had all obtained degrees from Washington State and it was the school 80 miles away that was responsible for Brookís 101 into the world of broadcasting.

After suffering through a day or two of macroeconomics lectures, Olzendam switched paths and enrolled in communication classes. The Murrow School of Communication put her in front of a camera, behind a camera and gave her every opportunity in between.

She produced an SNL-style comedy show for WSUís Cable 8 station. She gave weather reports. She broke hard news. She recapped a Cougar menís basketball game.

Bingo.

ìI was like, this is it. The second the light came on, I just felt energized,î she said. ìThis is exactly what Iím supposed to be doing, I love talking about sports. I love talking in general, I love telling stories, I love engaging people, entertaining people. It was just the perfect fit. Thatís when I knew, OK this is exactly what I have to do and thereís no other option for me.î

Olzendam graduated from WSU with a communications degree in 2003 and broke into the industry shortly thereafter, getting an entry-level gig with Fox Sports Northwest in Seattle. She split her time waitressing at a hole-in-the-wall Italian restaurant in Bellevue and logging tape for the TV station. After her shifts were over, sheíd spend extra time in the lab creating personal reels to pad her resume.

ìI would just shoot fake standups, put my reel together, go to the EP, say, ëTom, please look at this.í And heís got a million things to do, but heís like OK,î Olzendam said. ìSo heíd look at it and go, you need to do this, youíre a little too stiff here, this doesnít make sense. Blah, blah, blah. And so Iíd write it down, go out, shoot 10 more standups with that advice.î

Olzendamís on-camera debut came at a University of Washington volleyball game. She aced that test and earned more opportunities to work the sideline at Husky football and basketball games. Olzendam eventually became a lead anchor for the Huskiesí All-Access show and the jobs continued to get bigger and better. 

After awhile, she relocated to Los Angeles when she was offered a chance to host Fox Sportsí ìRunniní with the Pacî and simultaneously work the sideline at UCLA football games.

ó-

Basketball is a game of momentum swings. Olzendamís life wasnít immune to them, either.

Her first meeting with Andy Collins was a chance encounter. A friend of hers was visiting in Southern California when the duo stumbled upon Collins and one of his friends at a Venice Beach establishment.

Olzendam and Collins clicked. He hailed from Zillah, Washington ñ a tiny suburb of Yakima she knew of because of her fatherís pedigree as a small-school prep basketball coach.

Collins was a former University of Oregon quarterback whoíd backed up his best friend, Kellen Clemens, before transferring to NCAA Division III Occidental College, where he still holds a handful of school passing records.

Olzendam and Collins got married in Seattle in 2011 and moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where sheíd accepted a job with CBSSports.com.

Her spouse of less than two weeks was running on a treadmill when he collapsed from a heart attack. Collins, an aspiring pro football player whoíd led a healthy lifestyle, died at the age of 27, just 10 days after the wedding.

Shattered and devastated, Olzendam didnít go through with the job in Florida, instead retreating to her motherís house in Spokane. She buried herself in the dark, desolate basement for weeks at a time.

ìI was laying there thinking, if I donít get out of this bed I could literally never leave this house,î she said. ìI was in such a dark place.î

The depression didnít fully wear off and the scar of her husbandís death is everlasting, but reminded of Collinsí drive and go-getter mentality, Olzendam picked herself up and began browsing for her next opportunity.

In hindsight, she thinks she shouldíve spent more time recovering close to family and friends, but Olzendamís agent Bredes LaFemina found her a canít-miss opportunity in Indianapolis. The Indiana Pacers needed a sideline reporter. Olzendam pounced.

ìSheís the most amazing person I know,î Dave Olzendam said. ìSheís been through a lot and to see her fight back and be so strong, itís a blessing. She just keeps going and going and beats every challenge.î

ó-

Olzendam now has more than five years of NBA experience under her belt and sheís become one of the gameís most vibrant sideline personalities. She complements that with a sharp understanding of the game and an innate sense of her interview subjects.

ìShe really can read people well, which is a whole other talent,î said Jeff Curtin, Olzendamís boss and the Trail Blazersí Director of Broadcasting. ìItís like being able to understand when a playerís in a bad mood or a coach doesnít want to talk about this story. So she knows just from body language, being able to pick up on that is a huge trait that she has because itís tough.î

Her interview subjects may not know it, but Olzendam conducts deep studies of each player on the roster ñ their personalities, their comfort level in front of a camera and how theyíll receive certain questions. Then sheíll adjust accordingly.

ìLance Stephenson (of the Pacers) is a character, right?î Olzendam said. ìAnd so at first, I realized that quickly and so what worked with me for him is when I got him for a postgame interview, Iíd quickly tell him a few things I was going to ask beforehand. Because that worked for him, he didnít worry, he didnít stress and so he knew it was coming.î

Portland was one of a few NBA clubs without a sideline reporter two years ago when Olzendam made her pitch. The Blazers had become playoff regulars behind one of the leagueís most entertaining ñ and likeable ñ backcourt tandems and the fanbase grew with them.

ìIt was really one of the part of the broadcasts we were lacking was that extra storytelling,î Curtin said. ìThe play-by-play and the analysts really cover the game, but itís that other part of, inside the huddle kind of stuff and off the ball stuff.î

Olzendam, whoíd already moved to Portland to work for CSN Northwest ñ which has since rebranded itself as NBCS Northwest ñ pushed for Curtin and his team to add the position. It didnít hurt the sales pitch that sheíd be the one filling it.

ìRight time, right place for all of us,î Curtin said.

ìTruly when I say dream job, Iím not just blowing smoke,î Olzendam said. ìIt truly is.î

Olzendam attends every home game, shootaround and media availability, and she travels with the team on the road ñ a task that may be more grueling had her first year in Indiana not coincided with the 2011 NBA lockout, which occasionally forced teams to gut out three games in as many nights.

The Pacers had more of those back-to-back-to-backs than anyone else in the league.

ìIt was like a quick hello, a nice welcome to the NBA travel schedule because it was insane,î she said. ìBut you get used to it, itís just your way of life.î

ó-

Portland Trail Blazer fans flip on the live broadcast expecting to see Lillardís deep shooting, C.J. McCollumís crafty ball-handling and Jusuf Nurkicís savvy moves in the post.

Make no mistake, Dave and Alison Olzendam are basketball nuts, but when they turn on the television, theyíre anticipating the throws to the sideline reporter and then waiting anxiously for the postgame interviews.

Brooke and her father bonded over basketball, but she also owes credit to her mother, a former Whitworth professor who ìwas a strong female in my life,î and taught her daugher the precious life lesson to finish everything you start. 

ìTheyíve never missed a game,î Brooke said of her parents, who are now divorced and live on opposite sides of Washington ñ her mother in Spokane and her father in Bellevue.

David confirms: ìItís a religion now, I try not to miss any games.î

Commitment and dedication only befitting of the Olzendam name.

Paxton follows up no-hitter by facing Tigers
 What can James Paxton do for another encore? In his first May start, the Seattle Mariners left-hander struck out 16 Oakland batters. He followed that up by tossing a no-hitter at Toronto on Tuesday. Unless he pulls a Johnny Vander Meer and becomes the second pitcher in major-league history to throw consecutive no-hitters, it will be nearly impossible to top that feat. Paxton makes his next start Sunday at Detroit in the finale of a three-game series. Paxton normally keeps a low profile, but his last two outings have thrust him into the spotlight. He‚Äôd rather not have so much attention focused his way, but it beats the alternative, as he told the Seattle Times. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worth it, absolutely,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLike they say: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt do anything great if you can‚Äôt handle the congratulations.‚Äô It‚Äôs definitely been crazy.‚Äù Paxton (2-1, 3.40 ERA) walked three and struck out seven in his gem against the Blue Jays. The British Columbia native had plenty of countrymen pulling for him as he closed in on the no-hitter, which he finished by retiring Josh Donaldson with a 99 mph fastball. ‚ÄúEveryone was watching,‚Äù he told the Seattle Times. ‚ÄúI got all kinds of text messages and videos of people watching the last out. It was pretty amazing.‚Äù It was the Mariners‚Äô sixth no-hitter in franchise history. He carries a streak of 16 consecutive scoreless innings into his outing against the Tigers. In five career starts against Detroit, he‚Äôs 2-1 with a 3.19 ERA. If there‚Äôs one thing Paxton could use, it‚Äôs more run support. He has given up two or fewer runs in five of his last six starts yet has only two wins to show for it. He is fourth in the American League with 67 strikeouts. Manager Scott Servais returns to the bench Sunday after missing Saturday‚Äôs doubleheader to attend his daughter‚Äôs graduation. Seattle salvaged a split with a 9-5 victory in the nightcap after dropping a 4-3 decision in the opener. Blaine Hardy will oppose Paxton in what will be a momentous occasion for the 31-year-old left-hander. Hardy has made 167 major-league appearances, all in relief. Hardy tuned up for his start by throwing two scoreless innings at Texas on Wednesday after a five-pitch appearance the previous night. ‚ÄúThrowing (Wednesday) was a good step to making sure I have that longevity for Sunday,‚Äù Hardy said. Hardy, who has made six starts for Triple-A Toledo over the past two seasons, can mix up his pitches a little more as a starter. He throws a four-seam fastball, changeup, slider and curveball. ‚ÄúAs a starter, you‚Äôve got to use all four or five or how many you have,‚Äù Hardy said. ‚ÄúThe biggest thing is with 80 to 100 pitches, I‚Äôm going to throw all my pitches at least 10 to 20 times. You start to get a good feel for how to use them. It‚Äôs completely different throwing them in the bullpen to throwing them to live hitters.‚Äù Hardy has no-decisions in nine relief outings against the Mariners but has allowed only one run in 10 1/3 innings. The Tigers may play Sunday‚Äôs game without outfielder Nicholas Castellanos, who left the nightcap with a left pinkie contusion after being hit by a Felix Hernandez pitch. The teams will finish off the seven-game season series with four games in Seattle next weekend. Help | Press | Jobs | RSS | Site Map

Dwane Casey Wrote Raptors Fans a Thank You Letter
 
              The note comes a day after Casey was fired as Toronto's head coach.
            
             After being fired on Friday by the Raptors, former head coach Dwane Casey wrote a letter to thank the fans and the city of Toronto. The letter was published on Saturday by The Toronto Star. "Thank you to basketball fans across this city and the country of Canada who supported the Raptors and welcomed my family with open arms during our seven years here," Casey wrote. "Thank you to all the fans who cheered us on...and offered their undying support as we traveled this road to relevancy together. "Thank you for teaching our all-American family the Canadian way.

Vasiliy Lomachenko stops Jorge Linares with TKO in 10th round
 Vasiliy Lomachenko overcomes being knocked down to finish Jorge Linares in the 10th round, winning a title in his third weight class. (2:58) NEW YORK -- Pound-for-pound king and junior lightweight world champion Vasiliy Lomachenko entered the Madison Square Garden ring on Saturday night aiming to carve out yet another piece of boxing history. Now history is his once again. Lomachenko survived a sixth-round knockdown and a very tough fight to score a 10th-round technical knockout of Jorge Linares on a body shot to take the lightweight world championship before 10,429 in the main event of the Top Rank Boxing on ESPN card. With the victory, Lomachenko shattered the all-time boxing record for fewest fights needed to win a world title in three weight divisions, accomplishing that in just his 12th fight. Lomachenko broke the record held by Australian legend Jeff Fenech, a Hall of Famer who won world titles at bantamweight and junior featherweight before winning a belt at featherweight in his 20th fight in 1988. This was just another slice of history for Lomachenko, whose entire focus when he turned pro after winning Olympic gold medals for Ukraine in 2008 and 2012 was to make as much history as quickly as he could. He is widely considered the best amateur of all time -- 396-1 -- and he is convincingly making his case as the best of his time in the pro ranks. In his third pro fight, Lomachenko toyed with Gary Russell Jr. to win a decision and featherweight world title, which allowed him to tie the record for fewest fights needed to claim a world title. In his seventh fight, Lomachenko moved up to junior lightweight and scored a massive, fifth-round knockout of Roman "Rocky" Martinez to take his belt and set the record for fewest fights needed to win a world title in two weight classes. Now Lomachenko (11-1, 9 KOs), who made all four of his 130-pound title challengers -- Nicholas Walters, Jason Sosa, Miguel Marriaga and Guillermo Rigondeaux -- quit, moved up to 135 pounds and seized the title from Linares (44-4, 27 KOs), considered the No. 1 lightweight in the world going into the fight. "It was a great fight. That right hand [that knocked me down], it was a great punch. It happens," Lomachenko said. "I prepared for the last few rounds, and my father [and trainer Anatoly Lomachenko] told me, 'You need to go to the body.' "Linares is a great champion, and the fight was good for the fans and everybody." Punch statsPunchesLinaresLomachenkoLanded207213Thrown739627Percent28%34%-- Courtesy of CompuBox Said Linares: "The knockout punch was perfectly landed." Top Rank chairman Bob Arum, who promotes Lomachenko, gave credit to both fighters. "I thought the fight showed Linares is a helluva fighter, and Loma just stayed in there and knocked him out with a body shot," Arum said. "He established himself as a great fighter. He has a fighting heart." Linares, a 30-year-old southpaw, who has also won world titles at featherweight and junior lightweight, towered over the smaller Lomachenko and got his jab going in the opening round. He landed a couple of right hands to give Lomachenko something to think about. It had been a long time since an opponent had been remotely competitive against him in even a single round. In the second round, Linares, 32, a Venezuela native fighting out of Las Vegas, landed a hard body shot and an uppercut, but Lomachenko immediately responded with a left hand that got the crowd excited as it began to chant "Loma! Loma! Loma!" He closed with a good flurry to force Linares back. Lomachenko's advantage in hand speed was evident in the third round as he peppered Linares with quick punches on the inside and then spun away before he could fire back. By the fourth round, Linares' right eye began to swell. He has had issues with cuts and swelling in the past, and there is a lot of scar tissue over his eye. Linares, who was making the fourth defense of his second lightweight title reign, got a warning for a low blow from referee Ricky Gonzalez in the fifth round, and then Lomachenko rocked him with a left hook seconds before the bell. Linares took a second warning for a low blow in the sixth round. Lomachenko appeared to be winning yet another round in the seventh when Linares landed a clean straight right hand down the middle that knocked him to his rear end, but the round was coming to an end, and he could not get off another punch. It was the first time Lomachenko had ever been knocked down. "At first I thought it was a slip, but when I saw it again [on the replay], he got hit right on the kisser," Arum said. "I knew he was going to get up, but it was a legitimate good shot he got hit with." Linares didn't go right after Lomachenko in the seventh to see if he had shaken off the knockdown, but he looked like he recovered quickly and got back into a groove of firing punches and stepping to the side to get out of the way of Linares' return shots. They continued to battle back and forth even as Linares' face continued to look worse and worse. Lomachenko rocked him with an uppercut midway through the 10th round, but he continued to come at Lomachenko, who made him pay dearly. Later in the 10th round, Lomachenko unleashed a series of punches that sent Linares backward toward the ropes before a left hand to the body dropped him to a knee. He beat the count, but Gonzalez didn't like how he looked and stopped the fight at 2 minutes, 8 seconds, setting off a wild celebration in the arena from the pro-Lomachenko crowd. "He didn't surprise me as I thought he was going to surprise me," Linares said. "The fight was getting interesting. It was very close, but he did surprise me with that body shot. I wanted to continue. I wanted to keep working, but the ref stopped the fight." At the time of the stoppage, Lomachenko was up 86-84 on judge Steve Weisfeld's scorecard, Linares was up by the same score on Robin Taylor's card, and Julie Lederman had it 85-85. The fight was made thanks to the desire of both fighters to face each other and the cooperation between Lomachenko promoter Top Rank and Linares' co-promoter, Oscar De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions. They've had a bitter rivalry for years but managed to come together to give fans the best fight that could be made in the division. "Oscar said congratulations, great fight, and it was good to work with you," Arum said. According to CompuBox punch statistics, Lomachenko landed 213 of 627 punches (34 percent), and Linares stayed right with him, landing 207 of 739 blows (28 percent). Arum said Lomachenko will return to headline another Top Rank Boxing on ESPN card on Aug. 25 at The Forum in Inglewood, California. Before Saturday's fight, Lomachenko said he would remain at lightweight and give up his junior lightweight world title. If he sticks to his plan, he probably will face Raymundo Beltran in a lightweight world title unification fight. Beltran (35-7-1, 21 KOs) won a vacant title in February. "Beltran is the obvious opponent," Arum said. Lomachenko will be a big favorite against Beltran, as he has been against all of his opponents. But while his talent has never been questioned, one question lingered: What would happen when Lomachenko faced adversity? He answered in resounding fashion by getting off the deck to win against the best opponent he had ever faced. "We always knew what a great talent he is, but he showed he's a real fighter against the best guy he ever fought, a much bigger guy who knows how to fight, who was not going to quit and who was going to go out on his shield," Arum said. "Loma stood up to him and showed what he has deep down in his guts." We use cookies to offer an improved online experience.

2 HRs by Freeman, 1 by Bautista as Braves beat Miami 10-5
 MIAMI (AP) -- Atlanta Braves newcomer Jose Bautista is starting to look more comfortable at the plate, if not at third base. The six-time All-Star atoned for a costly error with his first homer of the season, and Freddie Freeman went deep twice to help Atlanta beat the Miami Marlins 10-5 Saturday night. Bautista made his first error of the year when he bobbled Brian Anderson's two-out grounder in the fifth. One run scored on the play, and Derek Dietrich followed with a three-run double to put Miami ahead 5-4. All four runs in the inning were unearned, but Bautista led off the sixth with the 332nd homer of his career. ''That was a tough inning for us,'' Freeman said. ''But Jose came back with a big home run that put us right back in the game.'' ''It somewhat of a redemption there,'' Bautista said. Atlanta broke a 5-all tie in the eighth, when Marlins relievers issued three consecutive walks - each on a 3-2 pitch, and the last two with the bases loaded. The 37-year-old Bautista was unable to find a job during the offseason. He signed a minor league contract with the Braves in April and was called up May 4. He hasn't spent much time at third base since 2011, but that's where the Braves need him. ''Because I haven't played there consistently in a long time, it takes a little bit of repetition to get back into it,'' he said. ''I'm starting to get there.'' With the homer, Bautista ended a streak of 13 consecutive hitless at-bats. He's hitting .167 with two extra-base hits. ''I didn't have a spring training,'' he said. ''The more pitches you see, the more comfortable you get, the more success you have. I'm swinging at good pitches; the results will come.'' Freeman hit a solo homer in the first and a two-run shot in the fifth, and he also walked and singled. Both home runs came off left-hander Jarlin Garcia, who gave up three homers for the second start in a row. He allowed five runs, four earned, in six innings. Miami's bullpen was even shakier. In the eighth, Ender Inciarte walked on a 3-2 pitch - the 13th he saw - to load the bases against Drew Steckenrider (1-1). Tyler Flowers also walked to put Atlanta ahead, and Johan Camargo drew a walk from Junichi Tazawa to make the score 7-5. ''They just kept fouling stuff,'' Steckenrider said. ''And I wasn't able to make the big pitch when I needed to.'' Inciarte added a two-run homer in the ninth , his second. BRAVES PITCHING Five relievers shut out Miami over the final 4 1/3 innings. A.J. Minter (1-0) retired one batter in the seventh for his first career win. Rookie Mike Soroka went 4 2/3 innings in his third start for the Braves and allowed five runs, but only one was earned. He struck out seven. FREEMAN STATS The multihomer game was Freeman's 13th, and his second this year. He had a career-high five hits Thursday against the Marlins and is now batting .331. Both of Freeman's homers came with two out. This year the Braves have scored 102 runs with two out, most in the majors. ''That's a good hitting ballclub over there,'' Miami manager Don Mattingly said. ''We're having trouble getting Freddie out. But he's not the only one.'' MARLINS ROOKIE Anderson's night was a mixed bag. The rookie right fielder mishandled Flowers' single in the second for an error that allowed an unearned run to score, but he made a strong throw to nab Freeman trying to go from first to third on a single in the ninth. ''That was a special throw right there,'' Mattingly said. ''I've seen some throws. I haven't seen one like that.'' UP NEXT Marlins opening day starter Jose Urena (0-5, 4.37 ERA) tries for the ninth time to earn his first victory when he faces LHP Sean Newcomb (3-1, 2.88 ERA) in the series finale Sunday. --- More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball

(John Woods/The Canadian Press via AP)(Photo: The Associated Press) WINNIPEG ‚Äî The Winnipeg Jets were in rhythm and the Vegas Golden Knights looked rusty. Or, maybe the Jets are just that good. Dustin Byfuglien scored about a minute after the puck dropped and Winnipeg built a three-goal lead early in the first period and went on to beat Vegas 4-2 on Saturday night in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals. While the Jets played at home less than 48 hours after advancing past top-seeded Nashville on the road, the Golden Knights were off for nearly a week after eliminating San Jose in the second round. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have much of a rest,‚Äù Byfuglien said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still in game mode.‚Äù Patrik Laine and Joel Armia had goals 46 seconds apart to put the Jets up 3-0. Mark Scheifele gave Winnipeg a 4-1 lead midway on a power play through the second period with his 12th goal this postseason. Brayden McNabb scored midway through the first and William Karlsson had a power-play goal late in the second period to pull Vegas within two, but the expansion team couldn‚Äôt get closer. ‚ÄúWe were chasing the game all night,‚Äù Golden Knights coach Gerard Gallant said. Winnipeg‚Äôs Connor Hellebuyck made 18 saves. More:Expansion Vegas thrives with team of 'misfits' More:Lightning eye bounce-back performance against Capitals Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 22 shots for the Golden Knights, whose Stanley Cup-winning goalie has given up at least three goals for the fifth time in six games. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the best goalie in the playoffs as far as I‚Äôm concerned,‚Äù Gallant said. Fleury and the Golden Knights will have to be at, or near, their best when the Jets host Game 2 on Monday night before the series shifts to Las Vegas. ‚ÄúNext game, no excuses,‚Äù Golden Knights center Jonathan Marchessault said. ‚ÄúEverybody needs to come and be ready to play our best game of the playoffs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to show what kind of team we are.‚Äù Winnipeg, which is making its deepest playoff run in franchise history, started strong and fast. Vegas, meanwhile, didn‚Äôt appear anything like the team that took the league by storm in its record-breaking inaugural season. The Jets‚Äô fast, deep and talented team had 114 points this season and trailed only the Predators‚Äô league-high total by three points. Their success has carried over into the postseason, winning all three Game 1s and avoiding trailing a series. The hard-charging, smooth-passing Jets put the Pacific Division champions on their heels right from the start and didn‚Äôt relent. ‚ÄúWe did take advantage of being game ready,‚Äù Winnipeg coach Paul Maurice said. White-clad, towel-twirling raucous fans in the arena ‚Äì and packed on surrounding streets ‚Äì were fired up before the game started. And, they were given plenty of opportunities to celebrate in the opening minutes. Byfuglien‚Äôs slap shot 1:05 into the game off a drop pass from Scheifele put Winnipeg up 1-0. That ignited the party-like atmosphere in a relatively cozy arena with just 16,345 seats and a low ceiling. Scheifele to Byfuglien just 65 seconds in pic.twitter.com/Drw1cVr9AU ‚ÄúThat was huge for us,‚Äù Jets center Paul Stastny said. ‚ÄúEarly in the game, too. And then all of the sudden it gave life to everyone, everyone on the bench, the crowd.‚Äù Fleury had no shot to stop Laine‚Äôs one-timer from the left circle off Wheeler‚Äôs cross-ice pass on a power play at the 6:49 mark of the first. Armia had a goal waved off less than a minute later only to have it restored by a challenge, which overturned the goaltender interference call on the ice. ‚ÄúSometimes getting your legs a little bit under you takes a few minutes here and they took advantage of it,‚Äù Fleury said. After the flurry of goals early, the Jets were able to play conservatively to cut down on Vegas‚Äô comeback chances. ‚ÄúWe were getting the puck deep,‚Äù Scheifele said. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt fooling around with it in the neutral zone.‚Äù The Golden Knights pulled Fleury to add an extra skater late in the game, but had to put him back on the ice because there was a faceoff near him. They sent him to the bench again and had some chances to pull within one, but the shot-blocking Jets didn‚Äôt let the puck get to Hellebuyck much. NOTES: The last time two teams were in the NHL conference finals for the first time was 2003 when Anaheim swept Minnesota. ‚Ä¶ Scheifele has four more goals than any player still in the postseason. ‚Ä¶ Fleury, a former Pittsburgh Penguin, has four shutouts this postseason and has allowed four goals in three games.

 METAIRIE, La. -- Saints running back Alvin Kamara stands first in line to see increased action with Mark Ingram serving a four-game suspension to start the regular season. Don't expect the Saints, however, to force feed touches to the all-purpose Kamara, who totaled 728 yards rushing and eight touchdowns on 120 carries and 826 yards receiving and five touchdowns on 81 catches in 2017. Instead, the Saints want to be smart about utilizing the NFL's reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year. "The mistake would be that Alvin gets 15 more carries and that's not the direction we would expect to go," coach Sean Payton said Saturday at the team's rookie minicamp. "I don't think that is wise." Saints running backs coach Joel Thomas echoed Payton on the dangers of projecting more carries for Kamara during the first four games of the season.

 "I think it would be a disservice to him," Thomas said. "Let's be honest here -- he's excelled with the ratio he's had, whether it's the carries or the combination with the catches, as well.  "It's almost a number that you want to get to that he's still getting the touches that he's had in the past. But maybe they occur through two, three or four more carries, and two or three less receptions. By all means, we don't want to sit there and run the tread off the back with him early in the season because this thing it's a marathon, 16 games. Four games there, I think we've got the talent -- offensively and in the backfield -- to go ahead and push through this little process." Payton said the team would be open to considering a veteran like Adrian Peterson if it came down to that. But the Saints currently don't plans to go that route and are comfortable in maintaining the status quo for now. In addition to Kamara, the Saints have Jonathan Williams, Daniel Lasco, Trey Edmunds and rookie Boston Scott, the team's sixth-round pick of the 2018 NFL Draft. "There will be a handful of other guys competing for those touches," Payton said. "Certainly, you miss something with a guy like Mark Ingram in those early weeks. But I think for us it's going to be evaluating that whole position and determining who can handle some of that role." Of the quartet vying to catch the coaching staff's attention, the 6-foot, 223-pound Williams offers plenty of intrigue.

 Williams, who played collegiately at Arkansas, landed on New Orleans' radar during the predraft process in 2016. But the Bills used a fifth-round pick on Williams in the draft and he produced 94 yards rushing and a touchdown on 27 catches in 11 games during his rookie season.  Buffalo released Williams in early September 2017 and he quickly signed with the Broncos practice squad. The Saints continued to keep an eye on Williams based on previous scouting and eventually signed Williams away from the Broncos practice squad leading to Week 11 of the 2017 season. "That's one of the reasons why we went ahead and signed him to our active roster," Payton said. "We thought he had real good vision and balance." With half a regular season and the entire offseason to absorb the Saints' scheme, Williams should be ready if called upon. And Thomas, who coached Williams at Arkansas, believes the running back's skill set translates well within the offensive scheme.  "He has a knack for what we call our slash game as far as puncturing and finding a hole," Thomas said. "He catches the ball decent out of the backfield, he's a bigger body and he can sustain some of the contact that's involved with playing the position. He's got some intelligence to him, as well. He'll be able to grasp this offense fine and he has."  In the meantime, losing Ingram to start the regular season certainly provides a blow to a Saints' ground game that finished the 2017 season ranked fifth in the league (129.4 yards per game). But the Saints are in good hands with Kamara, and the team looks forward to seeing whether Williams, Lasco, Edmunds or Scott can emerge to take on a complementary role.  "I'm anxious to evaluate the guys that we have here and our numbers here right now," Payton said.

Reigning NBA champ Warriors face season-best Rockets in West final
 Washington (AFP) - Defending NBA champion Golden State, seeking a third title in four seasons, faces season wins leader Houston in a tantalizing playoff showdown between a powerhouse Warriors squad and a Rockets team assembled to beat it. "I like where we are. Our guys have rings. That's a good position to be in," said Golden State coach Steve Kerr, whose Warriors open the best-of-seven Western Conference finals at Houston on Monday in search of a fourth straight trip to the NBA Finals. "We're going in here knowing we're the defending champs, knowing we got a couple championships here the last few years. Let's go get another one. It's a nice feeling to have to go into a series with." The Rockets, sparked by NBA scoring champion James Harden, were 2-1 against Golden State in the regular season and went a league-best 65-17 overall, seizing a home-court advantage in the series. After being ousted from the playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs in three of the past four seasons, the Rockets added star guard Chris Paul and 3-point threat P.J. Tucker to join Trevor Ariza, then watched Swiss big man Clint Capela enjoy a career-best season with 13.9 points and 10.8 rebounds a game. "It's going to be a fight," Capela said. "This team is going to be hard. There are going to be a lot of adjustments after every game. It's going to be a chess game." The clash between the two offensively explosive teams has been anticipated since the start of the season. "You wanted us. You got us. Now you've got to play the game," said outspoken Golden State forward Draymond Green. "Their team is built to beat us, their obsession. "Obviously you want to build your team to beat the defending champs because that's usually how you've got to go to get a championship. Understandable. That stuff has been said for about a year now. It's time to play." Green says the Warriors are all about adding another title, not ousting imitators. "We won two championships in three years. We're not about to run off talking about how bad we want to play somebody," Green said. "We want to win another championship and it don't matter who is in the way of that." - 'We're definitely threatened' - Past NBA Most Valuable Players Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry join Green, Andre Iguodala and 3-point sharpshooter Klay Thompson in a starting lineup dubbed "Death" or "The Hamptons Five." A rose by any other name is still tough to beat. "They are taking the challenge and they are embracing it," Kerr said. "We seem to be at our best when we are threatened. And we're definitely threatened." Curry has made a solid return after missing several weeks with knee and ankle injuries. "I feel good. I feel confident in what I'm able to do," Curry said. "I continue to get better, continue to get my timing right, continue to get back to the normal rotations." Golden State led the NBA in scoring just ahead of Houston this season. Now the Warriors rank as the top defensive squad in the playoffs just ahead of the Rockets. "We're going to be ready," Capela said. "Everybody is excited about it." - 'They have to be ready for us' - Harden averaged 30.4 points, 8.8 assists and 5.4 rebounds a game while Durant and Curry each averaged 26.4 points for Golden State this season and Thompson contributed 20 while Green is adding 13.1 points, 11.5 rebounds and nine assists in the playoffs. For Paul and Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni, it's a chance for their first NBA Finals berth. Harden made his alongside Durant with Oklahoma City in 2012. Now they all want to bring the Rockets their first NBA title since 1994 and 1995. "They are the champs. It's going to be tough," said Rockets forward Luc Mbah a Moute. "We have what we need. We're ready. They have to be ready for us as well. We showed all season we match up well with them. "We were the best team in the league all year but that's not our goal. Our goal is to go further."
Riding the Tiger High: When Woods is rolling, he's like a drug. It's impossible to get enough
 PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. ‚Äî Tiger's like a drug. When the Tiger High is over, what can replace it? Nothing. That's true for us, and it is surely true for him. He plays intensely and we watch intensely. That's the deal. If you're looking for more in your contract with Tiger, you're looking for too much. Woods holed out on 18 on Saturday almost two hours before the final twosome pushed in their pegs. His final moment was a half-footer a toddler could have handled for 65. And with that the holding pattern began. The day was over. Sorry, Johnny. I know you like Webb, and not just because he won an Open at your beloved Olympic. You did the best you could, but the man's lead is seven over Danny Lee. Yes, true: It wasn't over over at 1 p.m. It of course was not over for Webb Simpson ‚Äî he's trying to win his first tournament since 2013. Or Harold Varner III, looking to cash the biggest check of his career. (His T-7 finish at the 2016 Quicken Loans earned him $231,000.) Or Dustin Johnson, looking to retain his position at the top of the World Golf Ranking, where he's been for 64 weeks. Every player on this PGA Tour, along with the 7.6 billion other people in this world, has a story and there's not enough ink to tell them all. But golf has one best story. It is Tiger Woods, trying to recapture lost magic. He won't. But we watch because we are hopeful beings. It's in our nature. Do not ask the 42-year-old for command performances. Please. He can't, as we saw at Augusta. Woods did nothing there to make you sit up and take notice. At Quail Hollow, he did less. For about 11 years, beginning in 1997, he was a golfing machine. He had the goods. Now he doesn't, not like he did. Here's Saturday morning, knocking on your door and his. Surprise! A front-nine 30. Yowza. Center stage: As ever, all eyes were on Woods Saturday at Sawgrass. A mere two hours later, Woods handed his putter to Joe LaCava for the final time, made a few appropriate remarks to Steve Sands and split the scene. His wait began, as did ours. The waits vary. A day, a week, a year, a half-decade, a decade. Everyone knows he hasn't won since 2013 and hasn't won a major since 2008. The waiting is the hardest part. Here's a short one. Makes you think of those emergency rooms that announce their wait times in digital format right on a roadside billboard. Average wait for next meaningful Tiger Woods tee time-- This whole comeback thing Woods is on, it's not about winning, even though that's what everybody seems to want to talk about. Well, we've been conditioned all our life to think in terms of winning and losing. That old and awful Nike spot featuring Woods ‚Äî winning takes care of everything ‚Äî didn't help matters any. His first 12 holes ‚Äîeight birdies, four pars ‚Äî took your breath away not because they could lead to victory but because Woods, and not anybody else, was doing what he used to do. Typically, in sports and in life, what is gone is gone. He's not winning this week. Maybe he will at Jack Nicklaus's tournament in Ohio in a couple of weeks. Or at the U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills. Maybe he'll never win again. It really doesn't matter. What matters is, the man is trying. Isn't that the starting point for every worthwhile thing? You try. To the best of your abilities, you try. Tiger is a shadow of his former self, really. At 42, with a body reconstructed on surgical tables and in gyms, with a psychic life incomparably more complicated than we could know, it would have to be. But he's doing what we want to do ourselves, what we want our kids and our parents to do. He's trying. This guy is trying. It's not easy for him anymore. For a long time it was but now it's not. That's why we can't stop watching. His Saturday tee time at the Players was 9 a.m., right alongside all the other made-it-on-the-numbers, all the other 143s. (Meanwhile, Simpson had played those same 36 holes in 129 strokes.) Tiger's fourth-round Mother's Day tee time is 2:05 p.m. ‚Äî with Jordan Spieth. How good is that? Jordan is all about we-we-we. Tiger's not, and that's not a dig. He's the one who plays the shots. Anyway, we know it's a team effort. There are Tiger's doctors. There's his former wife, and surely a nanny. There's an equipment guy at TaylorMade and equipment guys around that equipment guy. There's the physio in the Tour truck. There was of course Earl and there is still his mother, Tida. "My mom was the tough one," Woods said the other day. "She's a very tough lady. When you talk about discipline, the Asian culture is a little bit different and that's what I was raised on. My mom was tough but extremely loving and so supportive. I probably wouldn't have got this far without her because she's the one who took me to all the golf tournaments. She would drive an hour just so I could play nine holes in a peewee league. And so she made a lot of sacrifices for me to get here. And I can't thank her enough for it." Yep. Spieth is the best thing in this game right now. Plays his bottom off every time out, plays with heart and gratitude, talks beautifully and candidly about his internal life, keeps it all in perspective. Johnson is the game's most exciting player ‚Äî the power and the finesse, plus he's awash in all that I-don't-give-a-damn. Phil is Phil. A particular personality, engaging, thoroughly entertaining. Plus, he's a golfing magician, still ‚Äî at 47 fixing to turn 48. Rory's cool. Justin Thomas ‚Äî a savant and a good kid. I could watch Tommy Fleetwood all day long. But Tiger is absolutely completely sui generis, which is a fancy way of saying there ain't nothing like him. You cannot forget that Tiger is not like other golfers. His golf is different, his mind is different, his skin color is different, his ancestry is different, his life story is different. He is like nothing the game has ever seen before and is unlikely to ever see again. So when he played so beautifully on Saturday, word spread like a virus and all of golf had only one thing on its mind. You found your way to him Saturday morning, didn't you? If you care about this game, about second chances, about pushing the outer limits of human potential, you surely did. How does not matter. By phone, by iPad, by laptop. Your TV, your car radio. Your Twitter feed. If you care about the prospect of improvement, advances in medical science and a hundred other things, you were watching. As he played the par-3 17th Friday, I was nervous. He didn't play the Par-3 Tournament at the Masters this year, I'm guessing because he knew more bad could come from it than good. He rinsed a shot at a course opening last year. He's been talking this year about the chalets behind the tee at 17 and how they block out the wind. Hit it high and the wind will grab it. Hit it low and it won't. Distance as a function of altitude. This game is hard enough and if you think too much it gets impossible. You wanted to see him finish. He did. Two pars to end the day. Ends are tough. One good round doesn't mean much. He knows that. Tiger is golf's most private person and the game's most public commodity. The 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, which he won by 15, was one of the most intense sporting experiences ever, but also supremely boring. He wasn't going to make a mistake. Now we know all about Tiger's mistakes. He's more human now to us than he's ever been. On Sunday, he could shoot 64 or 74. Either way, we'll be watching. Because this whole thing, it's one big unknown. In it's own strange way, it's thrilling. Uncharted. He knows that and so do we. Surprise. Michael Bamberger may be reached at mbamberger0224@aol.com.
Players Championship 2018: For Webb Simpson to not win on Sunday? He'd have to make history
 A dejected Greg Norman, who squandered a six-shot lead and lost to Nick Faldo in the 1996 Masters.  (Photo: David Cannon/Allsport) PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. -- If it ain‚Äôt over until the fat lady sings I can hear Brunhilde bellowing on my iTunes as the final round of the Players Championship approaches. What would it take for Webb Simpson to NOT win Sunday at TPC Sawgrass? Only a little history. Seven times a player has blown a six-stroke lead going into the final round of a PGA Tour event. No one has ever squandered the seven-stroke advantage Simpson has over Danny Lee. RELATED: Webb Simpson increases lead to seven. A victory lap on Sunday? World No. 1 Dustin Johnson is alone in third, but he‚Äôs nine strokes back. Jason Day, who won here two years ago, is tied for fourth, but he‚Äôs 10 back. Tiger Woods, who has twice won the Players and shot 65 on Saturday, is another stroke back. So is Jordan Spieth. Imagine how different Sunday would look if Simpson didn‚Äôt put a chokehold on the tournament with 13 birdies, two eagles and just one double bogey and one bogey the last two days. Still, one can hope. That‚Äôs all anyone behind Simpson has. That‚Äôs what Nick Faldo had at the 1996 Masters. Greg Norman obliged, shooting a 78 to Faldo‚Äôs 67 and the Green Jacket went to the Englishman. Choking existed long before then, though. In 1928, Bobby Cruickshank shanked away his six-shot lead with a final-round 80 at the Florida Open to hand the title to Henry Ciuci. At the 1969 Danny Thomas-Diplomat Classic, Gay Brewer shot 73 and watched as Arnold Palmer charged from six back to steal the win. Less of a choke, but a loss nonetheless. Hal Sutton, who has twice won the Players, stumbled to a 77 on the last day of the 1983 Anheuser-Busch Classic. Calvin Peete ended up getting the win. Sergio Garcia led by six strokes going into the last day of the 2005 Wells Fargo Championship, only to shoot 72 and end up in a three-way playoff with Vijay Singh and Jim Furyk from which he was eliminated after three-putting on the first extra hole. Six years ago in Phoenix, Spencer Levin led by six going into the final round but shot 75 to finish third behind winner Kyle Stanley, who carded a 67 to secure the victory. There was also last year‚Äôs WGC-HSBC Champions, where Johnson shot 77 in a windswept  final round to lose to Justin Rose, who had a 67 that included a 31 on the back. And there was the time Alex Cejka led by five going into the final round of the 2009 Players, only to shoot 78 while Henrik Stenson raised the crystal trophy. Simpson will try to not add his name to the list. ‚ÄúIt's going to be firm and fast,‚Äù he said of TPC Sawgrass. ‚ÄúI can't force anything, even if I'm even through 12 holes. I've just got to keep going and take my chances when I can.‚Äù If anyone else is going to have a chance, they can look at not just history but at what Simpson has done. His 19-under total matches the tournament‚Äôs 54-hole scoring record set by Norman when he won here in 1994. There was also Simpson‚Äôs second round, when he played his first 16 holes in 11 under. There were some low numbers on Saturday, too, with Woods and Spieth each shooting 65. It‚Äôll take more than that, though. It‚Äôll take Brunhilde coming down with a case of laryngitis, and the biggest choke in the history of golf.

UFC 224 results: Live stream updates, highlights, fight videos - 'Nunes vs Pennington'

Yankees try for series win against A's
 NEW YORK ‚Äî Neil Walker signed in the middle of spring training and began the season as the starting second baseman for the New York Yankees. Then two weeks ago, prized prospect Gleyber Torres was called up to play second base every day. The move shifted Walker to a platoon at first base but hardly fazed the veteran. On Saturday, he delivered the game-winning single in the 11th inning. On Sunday, Walker and the Yankees attempt to get another series victory when they host the Oakland Athletics in the rubber match of a three-game set at Yankee Stadium. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a pro,‚Äù Yankees manager Aaron Boone said after Walker‚Äôs fourth career walk-off hit made it 18 wins in 21 games. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs proven who he is throughout his career and that‚Äôs a guy that can hit.‚Äù Walker went 2-for-5 and is hitting .360 with eight walks in his last nine games while seemingly contributing something to most of New York‚Äôs late-inning comebacks in recent weeks. Before this hot stretch, Walker batted .163 in his first 21 games after the Yankees signed him March 12. ‚ÄúAs a guy who‚Äôs played this game a long time, you know when it‚Äôs starting to come and when it‚Äôs starting to feel good,‚Äù Walker said. ‚ÄúIn Anaheim, I had a good series of hitting balls on the barrel and you just try to run with that and throw together good at-bats.‚Äù Walker‚Äôs surge is coming at a time when first baseman Greg Bird is rehabbing from right ankle surgery and could return in the upcoming weeks. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a guy who can fit in anywhere,‚Äù Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge said of Walker. Since Walker was able to deliver another key contribution, the Yankees can win their seventh straight series before heading out on an eight-game road trip through Washington, Kansas City and Texas. Oakland will be looking to rebound after wasting numerous opportunities. After hitting four homers and getting 14 hits in Friday‚Äôs 10-5 win, the A‚Äôs drew eight walks but were 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position and didn‚Äôt get a hit after the fifth inning. Khris Davis homered for the second straight game and has homered in his last three games at Yankee Stadium, but the A‚Äôs have dropped four of five since last weekend‚Äôs three-game sweep of Baltimore. ‚ÄúMost of our damage came early on. We got six hits,‚Äù Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. ‚ÄúWhen you get later on in the game like that, you feel like one hit‚Äôs gonna win it and they end up getting the big hit in the last inning.‚Äù Although the Athletics have 16 runs in the last two games, they are hitting .224 in the last five contests. Among those slumping are Matt Chapman (3-for-41 in his last 11 games) and Matt Olson (5-for-31 in his last eight games). New York‚Äôs Luis Severino (5-1, 2.21 ERA) will make his second attempt at getting a sixth win. He took a no-decision in Tuesday‚Äôs 3-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox when he allowed two runs and six hits in six-plus innings. Severino struck out 11, but one was a wild pitch on a strikeout in the fifth inning that ultimately led to 17 extra pitches, including an RBI single to Mookie Betts. Severino is 3-0 with a 1.54 ERA in his last five starts and has 21 strikeouts in his last two outings. If he can get at least 10 strikeouts Sunday, he will become the fifth Yankee to post three straight games with double-digit strikeouts. The others were Al Downing (four starts, 1963), Ron Guidry (four starts, 1978), Bob Turley (three starts, 1955) and current Yankees color analyst David Cone (three starts, 1998). On Tuesday, nine of his strikeouts occurred on sliders. In the 10-strikeout game in Houston, six strikeouts occurred on four-seam fastballs. Severino does not own a decision against the Athletics but has a 4.50 ERA in two starts against them. Brett Anderson will make the third start of his second stint with Oakland. So far, he is 0-1 with an 8.68 ERA after allowing nine runs (seven earned) and 10 hits in three innings of a 16-2 loss to the Houston Astros. The start against the Astros occurred after he pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings during a no-decision at Seattle in his season debut. Anderson is 0-5 with a 6.81 ERA in seven career starts against the Yankees. He last faced them in his final start for the Toronto Blue Jays on Oct. 1, pitching five scoreless innings in the final game of the 2017 regular season. Help | Press | Jobs | RSS | Site Map

Cleveland's starting guard missed practice Saturday and had a good excuse for his absence ‚Äî he graduated from college. Hill received his diploma from IUPUI and took part in commencement ceremonies in Indianapolis while his teammates got in one last workout before heading to Boston for Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. The 32-year-old Hill, who played for the Jaguars from 2004-08,¬†received his degree from the School of Liberal Arts. He was one of two student speakers to address the new graduates. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about how long it took me, it‚Äôs about finishing the job," Hill told The Indianapolis Star.¬†"It was definitely hard. There were a lot of papers I had to write toward the end of this year, tests I had to take, trying to find time in between practice and games to get those things done. It was tough, but I was so focused on getting it done because I put it off for so long." On his Twitter account, Hill showed off a "Jaguars" tattoo on his left arm. #IUPUIgrad18@IUPUI@IUPUIJaguars@IUPUIMensBball Final Walk Off pic.twitter.com/pDLoheyf65 ‚ÄúGeorge Hill is a role model for many people to follow," IUPUI Chancellor Nassar Paydar said.¬†"He is a story of commitment and persistence. What he has done has moved me and many others to come back and participate in the ceremony, to be role models, to let people know you can do anything if you put your mind to. Education is so important for prosperity of people and to get skills.‚Äù Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said Hill would rejoin the team in time for the series opener Sunday against the Celtics. ‚ÄúAll of them said how it was a great accomplishment to graduate," Hill said. "They understood. Yes we‚Äôre in the Eastern Conference finals right now, but they understood the magnitude of this. It‚Äôs always a big accomplishment to graduate from a university. They let me have this day.‚Äù Hill joined the Cavs in February, coming over in a trade from Sacramento. He was slowed by back spasms and missed three games in the first round of the playoffs against Indiana, but returned and played a key role in the Cavs' Game 7 win as well as Cleveland's four-game sweep of Toronto. Hill, who also played in the postseason for San Antonio and Indiana, has helped settle a troubling position for the Cavs. Cleveland traded All-Star guard Kyrie Irving last summer to Boston and have used numerous point guards this season. The Cavs struggled without him against the Pacers, but Hill returned for the series finale. Although he was on a minutes' restriction, he scored 11 points ‚Äî all in the second half ‚Äî and helped Cleveland advance. "He's been great," Lue said. "Just coming into Game 7 versus Indiana where he hadn't played in 3 ¬Ω games, to come out and play the half of basketball that he played, he was tremendous. So, just his experience of being in the playoffs, being in the Eastern Conference finals when he played for Indiana, playing against the Miami teams, he knows what it's about. So, it's great having a veteran like that on the team." Contributing: The Indianapolis Star A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.  Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Chicago acquired the pick Feb. 26 in a trade that sent forward Ryan Hartman to Nashville. The Blackhawks (33-39-10) also hold the No. 8 pick after falling one spot in the NHL Draft Lottery, held April 28. As the Presidents' Trophy winner this season, that is the highest pick Nashville could have had. If the Predators advanced to the Stanley Cup Final, as they did last season, the pick would have been No. 30 or No. 31. Nashville, the defending Western Conference champion, was eliminated with a 5-1 loss to the Winnipeg Jets in Game 7 on Thursday. Hartman was traded for the first-round pick and a fourth-round pick in the 2018 draft, and forward prospect Victor Ejdsell. The New York Rangers will have the No. 26 pick, obtained from the Boston Bruins as part of the trade for forward Rick Nash. The final four selections in the NHL Draft will be determined by the results of the conference finals. The losers of the series between the Washington Capitals and Tampa Bay Lightning, and the Jets and Vegas Golden Knights, will get picks No. 28 and No. 29. Only Washington holds its pick. The Tampa Bay pick will go to the New York Rangers as part of the trade for defenseman Ryan McDonagh and forward J.T. Miller. The Winnipeg pick will go to the St. Louis Blues as part of the trade for forward Paul Stastny. The Vegas pick will go to the Detroit Red Wings as part of the trade for forward Tomas Tatar.

MLB asks Cubs' Zobrist to stop wearing black cleats
 CHICAGO (AP) ‚Äî Major League Baseball has warned Ben Zobrist of the Chicago Cubs against wearing black cleats.
Zobrist posted a letter from the league office on Instagram saying the cleats he wore May 2 against Colorado violated the collective bargaining agreement. MLB says they must be at least 51 percent blue ‚Äî the Cubs‚Äô color ‚Äî and warned he could be fined and disciplined if he doesn‚Äôt comply.
Zobrist says he has worn black cleats for day games at Wrigley Field the past two years to honor the game‚Äôs past. He says he was inspired watching highlights of greats such as Ernie Banks and Stan Musial in the 1950s and 1960s.
Zobrist says feedback from fans has been positive. He questioned why the league is enforcing the rule now.
Cleveland pitcher Mike Clevinger recently got a letter from MLB warning him against further wearing of his tie-dye cleats.

Former Rebel Chad Kelly has chance to win Broncos' backup QB job
 ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) ‚Äî Not even the signing of free agent Case Keenum could keep the Broncos from staging yet another quarterback competition this offseason.
This time it‚Äôs a battle for the backup job.
After bypassing a quarterback in a draft that was deep on passing prospects, general manager John Elway declared that Paxton Lynch and Chad Kelly would duke it out for the No. 2 job.
That served as a vote of confidence in Lynch, his 2016 first-round pick who hasn‚Äôt been able to win the starting job, and a golden opportunity for Kelly, ‚ÄúMr. Irrelevant‚Äù in 2017 as the last player picked in the draft.
‚ÄúWith Paxton, we still think he is young. We are not kicking him to the curb. He can still develop. When we drafted him two years ago, we knew it was going to take some time,‚Äù Elway said. ‚ÄúPaxton is going to compete with Chad for that backup spot. We are not going to bring another one in for OTAs.‚Äù
That marked the first time Elway had publicly mentioned Kelly as having a chance to win a roster spot a year after missing his entire rookie season while recovering from wrist and knee surgeries.
‚ÄúI thought of it as, OK, perfect, I can get more reps,‚Äù Kelly said Saturday after serving as the only quarterback during a 90-minute walkthrough that capped the Broncos‚Äô three-day rookie orientation. ‚ÄúI just look at it as another opportunity to get better each and every day and each and every rep.‚Äù
Kelly‚Äôs offseason work habits have resulted in a reshaped body.

Kelly said ‚Äúeating a lot of spinach and chicken paid off instead of fried food. ‚Ä¶ I came here and knew I needed to move around and get back to my old playing weight back in early college and high school. So, I‚Äôm kind of feeling I can move around and so some things with my legs but also be powerful in throwing the ball.‚Äù
Kelly has impressed both on and off the field.
‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve been proud of Chad overall,‚Äù coach Vance Joseph said. ‚ÄúI mean, he‚Äôs been here every day. He‚Äôs worked his butt off. And he‚Äôs changed his body. Last year he was a little tubby kid. He is really lean now. He‚Äôs eating right. He‚Äôs working hard. He‚Äôs definitely put the work in.
‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs throwing the ball really well right now.‚Äù
So much so that bare hands are a bad idea for receivers, suggested tight end Jake Butt.
‚ÄúHe can rip that thing now,‚Äù said Butt, who also sat out his rookie season. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve definitely got to wear gloves. He‚Äôll be spinning that bad boy pretty tough. He‚Äôs learning the offense, he‚Äôs taking leadership, he‚Äôs doing a great job.‚Äù
Joseph insisted Lynch was handling himself fine, too.
In March, the Broncos declared Keenum the starter as soon as he signed. In April, they said Lynch would have to beat out Kelly for the backup job.
‚ÄúI think Paxton‚Äôs done a good job, also,‚Äù Joseph said. ‚ÄúI think for Paxton and for our football team, it‚Äôs been a weight off all of our backs to have a starting quarterback and have everyone‚Äôs role defined from Day 1.‚Äù
He said that allows Lynch to ‚Äúrelax and get better each day and not worry about a competition.‚Äù
Joseph suggested Lynch could learn how to handle adversity from Keenum.
‚ÄúCase has been through some ups and downs throughout his career. So, he can learn from Case on how to handle those things,‚Äù Joseph said. ‚ÄúAnd it takes time to be an NFL quarterback. And you would hope with Case being here, he can sit back and relax and get better as a quarterback and not worry about being the guy right now and just compete to be our backup.‚Äù

And you would hope with Case being here, he can sit back and relax and get better as a quarterback and not worry about being the guy right now and just compete to be our backup.‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî

  After bypassing a quarterback in a draft that was deep on passing prospects, general manager John Elway declared that Paxton Lynch and Chad Kelly would duke it out for the No. 2 job.
That served as a vote of confidence in Lynch, his 2016 first-round pick who hasn‚Äôt been able to win the starting job, and a golden opportunity for Kelly, ‚ÄúMr. Irrelevant‚Äù in 2017 as the last player picked in the draft.
‚ÄúWith Paxton, we still think he is young. We are not kicking him to the curb. He can still develop. When we drafted him two years ago, we knew it was going to take some time,‚Äù Elway said. ‚ÄúPaxton is going to compete with Chad for that backup spot. We are not going to bring another one in for OTAs.‚Äù
That marked the first time Elway had publicly mentioned Kelly as having a chance to win a roster spot a year after missing his entire rookie season while recovering from wrist and knee surgeries.
‚ÄúI thought of it as, OK, perfect, I can get more reps,‚Äù Kelly said Saturday after serving as the only quarterback during a 90-minute walkthrough that capped the Broncos‚Äô three-day rookie orientation. ‚ÄúI just look at it as another opportunity to get better each and every day and each and every rep.‚Äù
Kelly‚Äôs offseason work habits have resulted in a reshaped body.

Kelly said ‚Äúeating a lot of spinach and chicken paid off instead of fried food. ‚Ä¶ I came here and knew I needed to move around and get back to my old playing weight back in early college and high school. So, I‚Äôm kind of feeling I can move around and so some things with my legs but also be powerful in throwing the ball.‚Äù
Kelly has impressed both on and off the field.
‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve been proud of Chad overall,‚Äù coach Vance Joseph said. ‚ÄúI mean, he‚Äôs been here every day. He‚Äôs worked his butt off. And he‚Äôs changed his body. Last year he was a little tubby kid. He is really lean now. He‚Äôs eating right. He‚Äôs working hard. He‚Äôs definitely put the work in.
‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs throwing the ball really well right now.‚Äù
So much so that bare hands are a bad idea for receivers, suggested tight end Jake Butt.
‚ÄúHe can rip that thing now,‚Äù said Butt, who also sat out his rookie season. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve definitely got to wear gloves. He‚Äôll be spinning that bad boy pretty tough. He‚Äôs learning the offense, he‚Äôs taking leadership, he‚Äôs doing a great job.‚Äù
Joseph insisted Lynch was handling himself fine, too.
In March, the Broncos declared Keenum the starter as soon as he signed. In April, they said Lynch would have to beat out Kelly for the backup job.
‚ÄúI think Paxton‚Äôs done a good job, also,‚Äù Joseph said. ‚ÄúI think for Paxton and for our football team, it‚Äôs been a weight off all of our backs to have a starting quarterback and have everyone‚Äôs role defined from Day 1.‚Äù
He said that allows Lynch to ‚Äúrelax and get better each day and not worry about a competition.‚Äù

Rod Wood Talks Matt Patricia Sexual Assault Allegation, Says Lions Followed Law
  Detroit Lions president Rod Wood said Saturday that the organization followed the law in its interviewing and hiring of head coach Matt Patricia. According to ESPN.com's Michael Rothstein, Wood responded to suggestions the interview process should have uncovered the¬†sexual assault indictment against Patricia in 1996 "There's been a lot of criticism of people interviewing and questions that were asked that are inappropriate, at the combine and et cetera. And we're not one of those teams that are going to do those kind of things whether it's a player, a coach or an employee. We're following the rules and I'd rather follow the rules and maybe end up where I'm at, although we're not happy to be dealing with this, there's no doubt about that. "But I'd rather be doing that than have broken the rules and had an issue that we were in an unlawful position by having some information. So there's no doubt it's a tough spot to be but I'll take the tough spot by following the rules versus not following the rules and being in an unlawful position." This week, Robert Snell of the¬†Detroit News¬†reported that Patricia was indicted on a sexual assault charge in 1996¬†while he was a student at¬†Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The allegation¬†stemmed from an encounter at spring break in¬†South Padre Island, Texas, The case never went to trial, as the accuser did not cooperate following the indictment. Wood and the Lions used a firm to do a background check on Patricia, but federal law prohibited the hiring process taking¬†felony arrests that did not result in convictions beyond seven years old into consideration, per Rothstein. On Saturday, Wood defended the firm it used in doing its due diligence on Patricia:¬†"We always err on the side of hiring a firm who understands all the laws, follows them, state and federal, so that we don't happen upon something that we're not entitled to have nor would we be able to use." After news of Patricia's indictment came to light, the former New England Patriots defensive coordinator said, "I was innocent then, and I am innocent now. I was falsely accused of something that I did not do." In a joint statement from Lions owner Martha Ford, general manager Bob Quinn and Wood, the Lions publicly supported Patricia on Monday, according to¬†Justin Rogers¬†of the¬†Detroit News: "As an organization, The Detroit Lions take allegations regarding sexual assault or harassment seriously. Coach Patricia was the subject of a standard pre-employment background check which did not disclose this issue. We have spoken to Coach Patricia about this at length as well as the attorney who represented him at the time. Based upon everything we have learned, we believe and have accepted Coach Patricia's explanation and we will continue to support him. We will continue to work with our players and the NFL to further awareness of and protections for those individuals who are the victims of sexual assault or violence." The 43-year-old Patricia has been an NFL coach since joining the Patriots as an offensive assistant in 2004. He has served in several different roles since then and was the Pats' defensive coordinator from 2012 until his hiring by the Lions this offseason. The three-time Super Bowl champion was hired to replace Jim Caldwell, who led Detroit to a 9-7 record in 2017.
Harvey on Reds debut: 'It's a good first start'
 Matt Harvey explains how it felt to get back on the mound in his debut with the Reds on Friday night. (1:20) LOS ANGELES -- Matt Harvey fired a second-inning fastball that felt noticeably good coming out of his hand -- better than any pitch had felt in a long time. He peeked at the right-field scoreboard to check whether the radar gun validated his inclination. It read 96 mph. "I hadn't seen that in a while," Harvey said. "It was good to know it's still in there." Harvey breezed through four scoreless innings in his Cincinnati Reds debut on Friday night, giving up only one hit -- on a fly ball that should have been caught -- and striking out two batters in a matchup against the struggling Los Angeles Dodgers, setting the tone in an eventual 6-2 victory at Dodger Stadium. Harvey, on a limited pitch count for what represented his first start in more than three weeks, required only 55 pitches to record 12 outs. Thirty-two of them were strikes and two of them reached a season-high velocity of 95.8 mph. "It's a good first start," Harvey said, his 2018 ERA dropping from 7.00 to 6.10. "Obviously it's only four innings; there's a lot of work and a lot of season left. But I think to go out there and be successful and get outs, help a team win, is very important." Harvey, acquired from the New York Mets only three days earlier, took the mound after a 34-pitch, 21-minute top of the first inning. The 29-year-old right-hander felt what he called "first-time jitters," and it showed when his first three fastballs veered off the plate. But Harvey came back to retire Chase Utley on a flyout, then made quick work of the next three hitters.

Also: Are no-hitters still interesting? From becoming a hero in Queens to an abrupt exit from New York, Matt Harvey's career has been full of highs and lows. With one out in the second, Cody Bellinger hit a towering fly ball that resulted in a triple after right fielder Scott Schebler lost sight of it. Harvey brushed it aside, struck out Chris Taylor on a high slider, then got Max Muncy to line out to center field. The next six batters were retired in short order. "He threw the ball well," said Reds interim manager Jim Riggleman, who will start Harvey again on the road against the San Francisco Giants on Wednesday. "All of his pitches were working." Harvey, once hailed as "The Dark Knight," was arguably the game's greatest pitcher for a brief moment in time. He started the All-Star Game and finished fourth in National League Cy Young Award voting during his first full major league season in 2013. Tommy John surgery followed shortly thereafter, but Harvey was once again dominant throughout 2015, a World Series-bound season that saw him rack up significantly more innings than he and his agent, Scott Boras, anticipated. Harvey hasn't been the same since. His 2016 season began with diminished velocity and ended with surgery to repair thoracic outlet syndrome, a procedure that has proven exceedingly difficult for pitchers from which to recover. His 2017 season included a stress fracture in his shoulder and was bookended by struggle. In 2018, he was demoted to the bullpen, then designated for assignment after refusing a trip to the minor leagues, then dealt to the last-place Reds in exchange for a catcher, Devin Mesoraco, and some cash. Harvey posted a 2.53 ERA in 427 innings from 2012 to 2015 but collected a 5.93 ERA in 212 1/3 innings with the Mets over these past three years, his velocity dropping from 97 mph to about 93. He gave up 21 runs, 33 hits and nine walks in his first 27 innings of 2018, but he spoke optimistically upon meeting his new Reds teammates on Thursday afternoon. "It's in there," Harvey said then. "It just needs to come out. I just need to relax and let it happen." Reds catcher Tucker Barnhart didn't have much time to prepare for Harvey's debut, but he made the most of it. He came in at about 1 p.m. PT, watched video of Harvey's starts from 2013 and 2015, looked closely at his usage patterns, then cross-referenced it with what he did over these past three seasons. "It helped out," Barnhart said. "I felt we were able to use a good four-pitch mix tonight. That was something that I had seen in the video that lacked a little bit [in recent years], whether it was based on circumstance or something that he was trying to do. It didn't sound like he was aiming to do that; it just seemed like it was circumstantial." Harvey threw 31 fastballs Friday. But Riggleman was impressed with the sharpness of his slider and changeup, and Harvey also flipped a handful of curveballs in for good measure. He generated only two swinging strikes and recorded nine of his outs through the air, a trend that will not play favorably at the Reds' unforgiving home stadium. But Harvey experienced real, legitimate success Friday night, and that in itself is valuable. "I didn't really know what to expect," Riggleman said. "I was just really happy for him." "It's a competitive game, so no matter what, you're always going to try to get better and better each time," Harvey said when asked if four innings was enough to validate his belief that he could continue to be an effective starting pitcher. "Tonight was a good first start, and we just have to keep working from here." We use cookies to offer an improved online experience.
