Trump Calls For Congress To Stay In Town If Wall, Funding Don't Get Done
Trump Calls For Congress To Stay In Town If Wall, Funding Don’t Get  Donald Trump issued some harsh demands on Twitter on Saturday afternoon, calling for members of Congress to get a few essential items checked off the to-do list before they leave Capitol Hill for their annual August recess.


The Senate should get funding done before the August break, or NOT GO HOME. Wall and Border Security should be included. Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations, worst in history. Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct, all they know how to do. STAY!

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2018


In addition to demanding that funding be established for the wall and for border security, the president took aim at Senate Democrats and accused them of holding up the line with regard to confirmations.











The idea that President Trump’s nominees are being “slow-walked” is certainly not new — the administration has been accusing Democrats of obstructing nominees for multiple positions since President Trump took office.

Then White House press secretary Sean Spicer told a group of reporters just before the inauguration, “The Democratic leadership is not working with us to ensure continuity of government. Let’s get it done. This is not time for partisan politics.”
CNN on Venezuela’s Oil Industry Collapse: No Mention of Socialism or Maduro
Wednesday, CNN presented yet another story about Venezuela’s implosion which did a fine job of portraying that country’s human misery, this time in the oil industry. Unfortunately, it was yet another example of a story failing to mention its socialist form of government or even its leader, President Nicolas Maduro. Though such omissions have long been routine in establishment press reports, reporter Stefano Pozzebon’s were particularly galling, given that the governments of Maduro and especially Hugo Chavez, his Bolivarian socialist predecessor, are entirely responsible for Venezuela’s oil collapse.



Though it was nationalized in 1976 as PDVSA (Petroleum of Venezuela), the industry functioned creditably  until 2002, when then-President Hugo Chavez fired 18,000 workers (40 percent of PDVSA’s workforce) and replaced them with party loyalists.

From that point, though PDVSA failed to achieve its full capabilities, production remained mostly steady until early 2015. After that, daily production began falling steeply. It has recently cratered disastrously:



Outside industry analysts estimate that April’s daily production fell to 1.50 million barrels per day.

As CNN’s Pozzebon reported, conditions have become intolerable:

Venezuela’s once-proud oil industry is collapsing

What was once the backbone of Latin America’s most prosperous nation is now a constellation of rundown projects, shuttered infrastructure and empty stillness.

… “When we started working in 2005, there were several wells working. Now you rarely see five or six wells working, at least in this area,” says Jose Luis Ramirez, a rig operator at one of the wells Chinese oil company CNPC operates as part of a joint venture with Venezuela’s state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA.

… “We have to sell our trousers to live. The boots, the gloves, every time we receive the kit, every few months, we have to sell it to buy food,” Ramirez said.

… An oil worker who did not wish to be identified recalled that his salary used to be more than enough to feed his five children, and buy extras.

A family like his would need almost 30 million bolivars per month, according to consumer groups. His salary as an oilman earns him approximately 2.5 million Bolivars.

“Sometimes I cry alone, because I can’t give my kids what they are asking for,” the oilman added.

The numbers that tell the tragedy of the Venezuelan crisis are comparable to those of a civil war or a foreign invasion.

… around Punta de Mata … most oil wells are not in operation.

The narrative follows a common pattern. A mechanical part breaks down, but there are no replacements so the oil well falls into disuse. Once a well is exhausted, no new wells are drilled. If an accident requires a well to be shut, it is not reopened.


The final excerpted paragraph explains why it’s overwhelmingly likely that production will continue to fall.

A separate video currently posted at Pozzebon’s story at least cited massive executive-suite corruption at PDVSA, named Maduro, and aired a petroleum workers’ union leader’s harsh criticism. But it too failed to mention socialism.

Boughton Gets GOP Nomination For Governor, Primary Ahead
Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton exercised some of his previous statewide demons by securing the nomination of his party for governor.
Boughton will enter the August primary as the endorsed nominee of his party, providing him a key talking point and symbolic boost as he looks to woo registered Republican voters.
“The moment is now, the time is now for Republican leadership and Republican values to make this state the place we all remember it to be,” Boughton said during his acceptance speech before more than 1,000 state Republican delegates.
Boughton has been Mayor of Danbury since 2001. He twice previously sought statewide office, unsuccessful each time. He entered the nominating convention as a favorite among longtime Republicans.
The final tally of 557 delegates for Boughton was exactly the amount he needed to outpace the field of eight contenders at the start of voting Saturday.
After the first ballot, the City of Stamford’s Chief Financial Officer, Mike Handler, and Glastonbury State Representative Prasad Srinivasan were each dropped because they did not meet the eight-percent threshold for support.
For Srinivasan, the result was devastating. He missed out on the second ballot by one vote, ending 18 months of campaign events, fundraisers, and debates.
“I thought I had it. I was sure about that,” Srinivasan said. “But I wanted to give this the opportunity to see if I can serve the state.”
After the second ballot, conservative Peter Lumaj, Shelton Mayor Mark Lauretti, and former Comptroller General of the U.S., Dave Walker, all were eliminated from contention.
The biggest winner from that ballot was Steve Obsitnik, the Westport businessman and Navy veteran.
Obsitnik squeaked past the eight-percent threshold during the first ballot, and successfully garnered more than 17-percent of the vote, securing a spot on the ballot for the primary in August.
Obsitnik, who previously lost a bid for Congress to Jim Himes, said he’s a “pragmatic” Republican who can appeal to independents in the progressive Northeast.
“You know what? Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, he’s a business outsider. He’s doing pretty well. I think we can take a page out of his book here in Connecticut,” Obsitnik said.
Tim Herbst ran just behind Boughton, and was a clear convention favorite among many convention delegates. He was the only other candidate to lock in a position on the primary ballot on the first tally.
Herbst, the former First Selectman of Trumbull who ran unsuccessfully for Treasurer in 2014, said he will look to separate himself as a straight-talking younger candidate in a crowded field.
“The way I am going to distinguish myself is I am not going to tell people what they want to hear in the name of winning an election. I am going tell people what they need to hear to save the state of Connecticut,” Herbst said. He secured more than 45 percent of convention delegates.
The August primary could get more crowded. Two candidates from the convention, Mike Handler and Mark Lauretti, vowed to collect signatures of registered Republicans. Two others, former UBS executive Bob Stefanowski, and former hedge fund manager David Stemerman also said they would look to collect signatures to achieve ballot access.
It’s possible that registered Republicans could be deciding amongst seven people when they vote in the primary in August.
Guest Opinion: Strengthened diplomacy the better path to nuclear-free world
The recent United States breach of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — the "Iran Deal" as it is colloquially known — is incredibly dangerous and demonstrates once again that the Trump Administration cannot be trusted to live up to America's international obligations.
Rather than increasing the risk of conflict by abandoning its commitments, the U.S. should be working toward a nuclear-free world. Continued diplomacy, not aggressive rhetoric or military action, is the only way forward.
The 2015 JCPOA is an international agreement under which the Iranian government agreed not to develop nuclear weapons, to reduce its stockpiles of enriched uranium and to open its facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections in exchange for the lifting of United Nations, European Union and U.S. economic sanctions. The agreement is multilateral, involving seven countries: Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. Luckily for humankind, after the U.S. reneged on its commitment, all other signatories to the agreement have stated they plan to ensure JCPOA's continued implementation.
This is important, because despite recent sensationalized, false claims to the contrary by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, there is no evidence that the Iranian government has pursued development of nuclear weapons in violation of the agreement. Netanyahu has a history of provoking the U.S. toward conflict. In the run up to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, he aggressively pushed the lie that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. Americans should be very skeptical of attempts like Netanyahu's to escalate tensions and stoke fear of Iran.
Moreover, it is imperative to situate the JCPOA in the broader context of worldwide nuclear disarmament initiatives. It bears remembering that we are approaching the 50th anniversary of the initial signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This treaty obligates all parties to refrain from developing nuclear weapons. Those treaty members that already possess nuclear weapons are required to eliminate their existing nuclear stockpiles.
The NPT has 191 member countries, including Iran and the United States, virtually all nations. As state parties to this treaty, Iran is bound not to develop nuclear weapons and the United States must eliminate its roughly 6,800 nuclear warheads. The JCPOA is a step toward Iran fulfilling its obligation. Meanwhile, the U.S. plans to spend more than $1 trillion over the next 30 years to maintain and upgrade its nuclear capabilities.

The U.S. has very little moral or legal standing to enforce the compliance of other governments when it has failed for 50 years to live up to its own legal responsibilities under the NPT. Ironically, given Netanyahu's repeated assertions that Iran operates a dangerous illegal nuclear program, Israel demonstrably has a clandestine nuclear weapons program that violates the international norm of nuclear disarmament. It is one of only four UN member states not party to NPT.
In light of this context, if the U.S., and its nuclear-armed allies like Israel, want to be seen as credible, reliable, and good faith negotiators by other governments, they should follow the same rules they attempt to enforce on others.
Threatening, and undertaking, aggressive actions against Iran only makes Iranians and Americans less safe. Peaceful, diplomatic tools such as the JPOCA and NPT exist. They can be strengthened and new frameworks can be created. Political will on the part of the current American leadership is the main obstacle standing in the way.

Russian Facebook ads played up Arizona murder-suicide in 2016 election
Russian ad on Facebook.

    Facebook

PHOENIX — The Facebook ad made a direct, if innocuous, appeal.
Days after two Glendale teenagers died in a murder-suicide in February 2016, a group identified as LGBT United sought to "protect the memory of the victims of hate."
The ad mentioned the deaths of May Kieu and Dorothy Dutiel at Independence High School and said, "This heart-breaking incident is all over the news and the comments are disgusting! Homophobes use the incident as a proof that love is a sin!"
      
A month later, other Facebook ads from LGBT United that ran nationwide rebuked politicians who "keep giving empty promises in order to win votes" and noted "hateful comments from the Hillary (Clinton) supporters about Bernie Sanders." 
The bogus group's Facebook ads were part of a broader campaign, congressional Democrats say, funded by Russian interests and designed to foment discontent.
On Thursday, Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released about 3,500 advertisements purchased on Facebook between 2015 and 2017 and traced to Russians.

"It doesn't surprise me that Arizona is pulled into this. They know when it comes to a certain level of propaganda and wedge issues, it has worked effectively here in Arizona," said U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who is not on the committee. "Also, we are a swing state, so it makes sense they would target us."
Gallego said he thinks the Senate and House Democrats are determined to do something about preventing similar ads in the future, and noted that Facebook could face a lawsuit over its practices.
Phuong Kieu declined to discuss the ads that invoked her sister, but indicated anything involving that matter was a source of renewed grief.
"What happened to my sister has become a public matter and unfortunately, humans can't leave the dead alone if it can benefit them," she wrote in an email. "My family lost May that day and we don't want to talk about this loss and pain anymore."
      
Facebook promises to do better
In a statement Thursday, Facebook acknowledged the company failed to sufficiently police its ads in 2016, but promised to do better.
"In the run-up to the 2016 elections, we were focused on the kinds of cybersecurity attacks typically used by nation states, for example phishing and malware attacks," the statement said. "And we were too slow to spot this type of information operations interference. Since then, we’ve made important changes to prevent bad actors from using misinformation to undermine the democratic process.
"This will never be a solved problem because we’re up against determined, creative and well-funded adversaries. But we are making steady progress."

More: Here's how Russian manipulators were able to target Facebook users
At least 18 Facebook ads, apparently paid in Russian rubles, specifically targeted Arizona audiences; many others were seen by broad audience types across the country, including Arizona. Overall, the suspicious ads on Facebook and Instagram were seen by more than 140 million people in the U.S.
Their effect in Arizona and nationally is less clear.
Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, won the national popular vote and finished within 3½ percentage points of Republican Donald Trump in Arizona, the best showing for a Democrat since then-President Bill Clinton carried the state in 1996. Still, Trump won the White House by carrying enough states to win the Electoral College.

Many of the ads, including some targeted to Arizona audiences, have been linked to the Internet Research Agency, described as a Russian troll farm. In February, Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 elections, indicted the Internet Research Agency and 13 Russians working for it on charges of criminally interfering in the election.
After seeking sympathy for the gay and lesbian community after the Glendale shooting in February 2016, LGBT United had other ads a month later that played up friction between Clinton and Sanders supporters ostensibly over a coloring book. 
      
"There is a new coloring book calling 'Buff Bernie: A coloring Book for Berniacs' is full of very attractive doodles of Bernie Sanders in muscle poses," the ad says in slightly fractured English.
"The author of the book said that she wanted people to stop taking this whole thing too serious. The coloring is something that suits for all people. I totally agree with her! I've recently heard some hateful comments from the Hillary supporters about Bernie Sanders and his supporters, so I really love the idea of this color book. I think that Bernie would love it!"
The March 24 ad ran two days after Arizona held its Democratic primary. Clinton won the state easily but dropped contests in Idaho and Utah and lost ground to the Vermont upstart, who carried his campaign through all of the primaries.

Another ad from LGBT United that ran about the same time — and was targeted in Glendale — vaguely condemned the status quo but didn't mention anyone in particular.
"Despite our race, religion, gender, age, education, sexual orientation and beliefs, we are all HUMANS," the ad's text said.
"In the midst of the presidential race, all what politicians dream about is money. They keep giving empty promises in order to win votes. And this is our friendly reminder for the candidates: we are the ones who elect them. We don't deserve having problems with employment, marriage, child birth etc ... We all deserve the right to be accepted."
Audience counted in the millionsSome of the ads were shared or liked more than a hundred times. The Sanders coloring-book ad generated less than 50 responses at the time of the screen grab shared by House Democrats. 
Jonathan Albright, research director for the the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, analyzed the Russian ads on social media and says that when comments and individual reactions are factored in, the Russian messages reached an audience counted in the millions.
                                
In June, Arizona was among a handful of states targeted with a series of ads presumably intended to stoke racial resentment.

    Russian ad on Facebook.

    Facebook

"The Original Statue of Liberty presented to the U.S. was a Statue of a..."Black Woman," read the ad from a Facebook account identified as Black Edification. It depicted the Statue of Liberty and what appears to be a statue of an African-American woman striking a similar pose.
The ad claimed that France originally offered a statue "to pay homage to the slaves whom were brought here by force."
Another ad noted Jesus Christ looked more like a contemporary Middle-Easterner than the painted "White Jesus."
If those ads, also linked to Russians, were intended to have a political effect on their targeted audience, they largely bypassed the most competitive states in the presidential election. Of the 10 states they appeared in, only Florida was seen as up for grabs at the time. Arizona continued to become competitive throughout the year.
In September, a different ad appeared in Arizona touting a message that had more political potency.
It apparently aimed to stoke the ongoing debate over illegal immigration and border security.

    Russian ad on Facebook.

    Facebook

An ad from an account identified as Secured Borders said simply, "Every man should stand for our borders! Join!" It included a picture of a rusted yellow sign that read, "No invaders allowed."
The ad, targeted to people with an interest in the Second Amendment, the National Rifle Association and Trump's candidacy, tapped into Trump's aggressive border-control message and may have found an especially receptive audience in Arizona.
The ad identified Secured Borders as a news and media website. A screenshot shows it had been liked 135,000 times, though it is unclear how many of those came from Arizona.
The ads from Secured Borders were traced to Russia as early as March 2016 and at least some media outlets noted it even as the ads continued to appear on Facebook into the fall.
      
The Russian-linked ads didn't end with the campaign or pander only to border hawks. 
In February 2017, Arizona was mentioned in an ad from an account named Brown Power, another fake group that purported to speak for Latino interests.
"How can we be illegal on our own land? The United States unfairly took from Mexico what is now the Southwest of the country in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican-U.S. War," the ad says. "The ceded territory included what is now Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, and parts of Colorado, Nevada and Utah."

Ukraine’s Fake UN: Kiev “Nazi Gangster Regime” goes “Full Goebbels” | Veterans Today | News - Military Foreign Affairs Policy
Russia’s Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has released evidence that Ukraine had organized an event dedicated to propaganda and fake news declaring it as part of a session of the United Nations’ Committee on Information, she wrote on Facebook on Saturday.

“I am publishing a screenshot of the card of Ukraine’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations inviting to the event on the fight against propaganda and fake news, where it is written in black and white that it is held under the auspices of the UN Committee on Information. And also, video of four statements of the committee’s chair who was trying to explain to the Ukrainian delegation in presence of other members of that body of the UN General Assembly that it was not so and that the committee had not authorized any events,” Zakharova said.

The diplomat suggested that Russian representatives might ask the UN to release video footage showing how persons invited by Ukraine were threatening a Russian diplomat.

“By the way, do you think if we will be able to get CCTV recordings at the UN Secretariat showing how camouflaged people were pestering and photographing our diplomat on the sidelines of that ‘session’? I think we should try,” she noted.


Earlier, Zakharova told reporters that participants in Kiev’s military operation in southeastern Ukraine threatened a Russian diplomat with death at the United Nations headquarters.

According to her, the incident took place on May 9, following a meeting on propaganda and fake news arranged by the Ukrainian delegation, which it claimed to be part of a session of the UN Committee on Information. The Russian diplomat expressed confidence that the incident was “part of Kiev’s information efforts negatively illustrated by the Mirotvorets [or Peacemaker] website, which still exists, where the personal information about staff members of the Press and Information Department at the Russia Foreign Ministry.” “Everything that the Ukrainian mission did is in line with Kiev’s policy aimed at intimidating Russian diplomats working in the information field,” Zakharova noted.
New court filing revisits misconduct in Bedford drug case
Misconduct by a federal prosecutor who concealed impeachment evidence about a government witness during a Bedford County drug case was “even more egregious” than disclosed in court, a Roanoke defense attorney said in a court filing.

Attorney Paul Beers claimed this week that Assistant U.S. Attorney Ashley Neese acted out of “personal motivation” to suppress information about lewd behavior by Christopher Cook, a Bedford County sheriff’s deputy.

Cook testified at a 2014 jury trial against a man later convicted of drug crimes in a case known as Operation Pain Train that Neese prosecuted.

A judge ruled on appeal in 2016 that Neese had misled the court about the officer and granted defendant Les Christopher Burns, who had gone to prison, a new trial.

After Neese was kicked off the case by the judge, prosecutors dropped the charges and Burns was freed.

Burns learned while in prison that a woman who testified before the Pain Train grand jury later complained to the FBI that Cook in 2012 made a lewd sexual advance toward her. Cook had been temporarily suspended and demoted. But Burns and his trial attorney were never provided a full accounting of the matter in time to challenge Cook’s credibility at Burns’ trial.

Neese, a lead Pain Train prosecutor, said during post-trial proceedings that she did not believe she was bound by any policy or law to disclose the officer’s behavior in detail. Her conduct was ruled a violation of the prosecutors’ mandate to share information beneficial to the defense.

Neese remained an assistant U.S. attorney and actively appeared in court on other cases as recently as last week.

Beers’ new filing, which appeared Monday in an unrelated case, said he provided U.S. Attorney Thomas Cullen on May 3 with “documentary and testimonial evidence that AUSA Neese had a twisted conflict of interest and personal motivation for suppressing” the information about Cook. No further details appear in the filing.

Beers was asked to elaborate Friday.

“I’m assisting someone in a pro bono capacity and I came across some information,” Beers said. He declined further comment.

Beers’ filing said that he believed Cullen would disclose the evidence to “the Court” after “further investigation” by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility or the FBI. Cullen declined to comment.

Neese was replaced this week by other prosecutors in at least three pending criminal cases she had been handling. Messages left on a phone number associated with Neese were not returned. She did not reply to a note left at a home she owns in Vinton.

Laura Rottenborn, executive assistant U.S. attorney, was asked Wednesday whether Neese remained employed at the U.S. attorney’s office.

“The USAO has no comment on personnel matters,” Rottenborn said by email.

Ukrainian ‘snipers’ threaten Russian diplomat at UN headquarters – Zakharova
According to Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman, the incident took place on May 9, following a meeting on propaganda and fake news arranged by the Ukrainian delegation






Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova

UNITED NATIONS, May 12. /TASS/. Participants in Kiev’s military operation in southeastern Ukraine threatened a Russian diplomat with death at the United Nations headquarters, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters.

According to her, the incident took place on May 9, following a meeting on propaganda and fake news arranged by the Ukrainian delegation, which it claimed to be part of a session of the UN Committee on Information. “An official from the Foreign Ministry’s Press and Information Department, who was representing Russia at the Committee’s session, attended the meeting. He clarified Moscow’s position concerning Ukraine’s accusations as the event was held in an anti-Russian atmosphere. As far as we understand, the Ukrainian delegation did not expect the Russian participant to address the meeting, it came as a surprise for them,” Zakharova said, adding that “the result was somewhat unpleasant.”

“The Ukrainian delegation said it had invited veterans of the [so-called] anti-terrorist operation [in Donbass], including those who were presented as snipers from southeastern Ukraine. After the meeting was over, these men, dressed in camouflage clothing, came up to the Russian representative and began to threaten him with death. Imagine people in camouflage clothing running around the United Nations premises, making photos of Russian diplomats and threatening them. Those were direct threats,” the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.

Targeted policy
The Russian diplomat expressed confidence that the incident was “part of Kiev’s information efforts negatively illustrated by the Mirotvorets [or Peacemaker] website, which still exists, where the personal information about staff members of the Press and Information Department at the Russia Foreign Ministry.” “Everything that the Ukrainian mission did is in line with Kiev’s policy aimed at intimidating Russian diplomats working in the information field,” Zakharova noted.


She added that at the Committee’s final meeting on Friday, Russia raised that question, stressing that events being held during the session “should not end like that.” “Death threats coming from people officially invited by a national delegation make to other participants in debates are a thing unacceptable on the United Nations premises,” Zakharova said. According to her, the United Nations has taken Russia’s concern into account and thanked Moscow for providing information, however, Chair of the United Nations General Assembly Committee on Information Jan Kickert “tried to shrug off this scandalous incident saying that no such events had been held on the Committee’s behalf.”

“We provided the Committee with a press release available on the Ukrainian mission’s website, as well as with screenshots and other files claiming that the event was part of the Committee’s activities,” the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. After that, the Committee assured the Russian mission that such things would not be tolerated in the future, Zakharova
Kevin Kamenetz's death will dramatically shake up Maryland governor's race
Before he died of cardiac arrest early Thursday morning, Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz was a formidable and leading contender in the crowded Democratic primary race for governor.
His unexpected death upsets the political landscape of the race, shaking up what was a seven-way contest of major candidates hoping to take on popular Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.
“This dramatically alters the race,” said Todd Eberly, a political scientist at St. Mary’s College. “His supporters are going to be looking for another option, and that could boost one or more of the second-tier candidates. There’s a solid quarter now of the electorate that’s going to be looking for another choice.”
Kamenetz consistently polled among the top three candidates and had raised more money than anyone else in the field.


            
            
  This week, his campaign had reserved more than $1 million worth of airtime in the Baltimore and Washington markets — the first Democratic candidate with the resources to do that. He was the race’s dominant political force in the Baltimore region, a battleground area crucial to winning the primary election less than seven weeks away.
“He’s a husband and father first. It’s also undeniable he was a major political figure and fixture in the state,” said Mileah Kromer, a political science professor and pollster at Goucher College.


      
        
    


          
  
      
  
    

Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz — a Democratic candidate for governor and a fixture in state and local politics for nearly a quarter century — died May 10 morning of cardiac arrest, officials said




“His absence will shake up the race,” Kromer said. “He had a serious record for any candidate to run on. That, of course, is a loss. That is a loss to the Democratic Party and a loss to the voters of Maryland.”
Baltimore County police said Kamenetz, 60, woke with chest pains at home at 2 a.m. and was pronounced dead less than 90 minutes later at a Towson hospital.


        
            Kamenetz spent the evening before he died at a gubernatorial forum in Bowie, the second in two days. A third forum scheduled for Thursday night was converted to a tribute to Kamenetz’s nearly 25 years in public service.
The two-term county executive’s sudden death left his campaign team stunned, grieving and groping for the next step.
“We really don’t know how to put it into words,” campaign spokesman Sean Naron said. “Right now, we’re focused on the fact he was the father to two teenage sons.”
Under election law, it’s up to Kamenetz’s running mate, Valerie Ervin, to decide whether to run in his place or choose another candidate, said Jared DeMarinis, director of candidacy for the Maryland Board of Elections.
Ervin has until May 17 — 40 days before the June 26 primary — to make a decision. She released a statement saying she was “heartbroken” over the loss.
The campaign declined to answer questions about plans.

        
  
      Kamenetz’s political rivals — he enjoyed a friendly rapport with many of them — canceled campaign events, suspended television advertising and issued statements praising his toughness and long record of public service. The major Democratic candidates in the race are Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker, former NAACP chief Ben Jealous, state Sen. Richard S. Madaleno of Montgomery County, tech entrepreneur Alec Ross, lawyer Jim Shea and Krish Vignarajah, a former aide to first lady Michelle Obama.
Campaigns for each declined to publicly discuss how Kamenetz’s death affected their strategies, but political experts said it will undeniably reshuffle the race. Voters who supported Kamenetz because of his ties to the Baltimore region, his experience as an executive or his willingness to attack the popular GOP governor will now need to give other candidates a second look, analysts and some campaigns said.
This is the first time in state history that a major candidate for governor has died so close to an election, according to John T. Willis, a former secretary of state, Maryland political historian and executive in residence at the University of Baltimore.
Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker, the front-runner in the race, released a statement saying, “Today is a tragic day in Maryland.

        
  
      “I am stunned by this news as I had just watched hours earlier Kevin passionately and eloquently share his goals, vision, and ideas for the state of Maryland,” Baker said. “As much as Kevin was advocating for what was best for Baltimore County, he was also always looking out for all Marylanders.”
Hogan, a frequent political sparring partner and critic of Kamenetz, tweeted his condolences early Thursday. An hour later, he honored his former rival by ordering flags flown at half-staff until after sundown on the day of Kamenetz’s burial. A funeral will be held Friday afternoon at the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation at 7401 Park Heights Ave. in Northwest Baltimore.
"He was a dedicated public servant in Baltimore County for more than two decades, and we join with the citizens of Baltimore County and all Marylanders in mourning,” Hogan said in a statement. "In the difficult days to come, we will provide any support we possibly can to the Kamenetz family and the citizens of Baltimore County."

        
  
      Hogan’s campaign staff declined to comment on how Kamenetz’s death changes the race.
“This is absolutely the last moment that political considerations should be taken into account,” Hogan campaign spokesman Doug Mayer said. “The governor is focused on sending love and thoughts to the county executive’s family in this time of incredible grief.”
Jealous recalled on Twitter that he was often seated beside Kamenetz at the many forums they’ve attended over the past year.
“I’ll always remember him for the grace and good humor he showed each of his fellow candidates as we’d line up backstage waiting to for the event to begin,” Jealous wrote. “He dedicated his life to public service, to making a difference, and he helped move Maryland forward.”
From hours together on the campaign trail, candidates forged friendly relationships, Madaleno said.
“Though rivals for the Democratic nomination, we’ve gotten to know each other well over the past year plus, finding a shared sense of wit and humor, as well as a deep love of family and our great state,” Madaleno said. “Kevin’s story of growing up in Lochearn, working at his father’s drug store and ultimately rising to become Baltimore County executive is a classic tale of Maryland grit and determination. His knowledge and dedication to all Marylanders will be sorely missed.”
Ross, who is from Baltimore, suspended plans to air television ads until after Friday’s funeral.

With an eye on 2020, Democrats jockey to define their party, and gain an advantage
The future of the Democratic Party has been booking late night TV gigs, waking up for morning drive-time radio and showing up at watering holes in rural counties to try out new material.
Before the start of a 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, at least 25 candidates - mayors, governors, entrepreneurs, members of the House and Senate - have hit the road to workshop their vision, experiment with catchphrases and test policy ideas that could keep President Donald Trump from winning a second term.
Many deny that their actions have anything to do with a coming presidential run, but they unmistakably play off the chords of campaigns past, seeking a way to break through a political maw that has been focused more on the latest actions of the president and the coming midterm elections.
"I don't want to speak to Democrats only," says Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who recently appeared on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live to riff on the Founding Fathers' vision of patriotism and love. "I'm talking to us as Americans, about how this is a moral moment."


            
            
  In front of policy conferences and campaign rallies for congressional candidates, former vice president Joe Biden has been updating his own paeons to the middle class, repeating his thematic refrain that "America is all about possibilities." Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has broadened her calls for people to "fight back," and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has demanded that "we must speak truth."
"This is like taking the play to Topeka and New Haven to see what works before you even get to Broadway," said David Axelrod, a former strategist for President Barack Obama who hosts would-be candidates for public forums at the University of Chicago. "The season hasn't opened."
At stake in the rehearsals is nothing less than the future of the Democratic Party, which has yet to congeal around a positive vision. Party leaders privately talk about the next two years as a potential pivot point for what it means to be a Democrat, like the tumultuous 1968 Democratic convention or the business-friendly realignment that followed President Bill Clinton's nomination in 1992.
"The Democratic trajectory right now is more uncertain than it has been since I started in politics in the 80s," said Simon Rosenberg, a longtime Democratic strategist at NDN, a think tank. "And I think no one has a leg up."


        
            The questions are big ones - of style and policy - that can only be answered in the story told by the candidate who eventually captures the party's imagination.
Some promote a vision of a youthful future, while others speak of their own wizened experience. Some use the language of the private sector, while others have begun to promote guaranteeing public sector jobs for all unemployed Americans. Some speak of class as the defining American divide, while others focus first on racial and gender inequality. Some are brawlers ready to take on Trump, while others pose as healers to call the country back to better angels.
They have begun to grapple with the sense that Trump's presence has erased all of the old rules, even for Democrats, and that the party should consider looking outside the standard roster of governors and senators - perhaps to a businesswoman-entertainer like Oprah Winfrey, who has so far resisted calls for her to run, or a mayor.
"My theory of this election is you are going to basically have a swing back," said Julián Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who has been traveling the country talking about "expanding opportunity." "People are going to look for someone who can unite the country instead of divide it, someone they can trust."
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who will speak Sunday at a graduation in the first primary state of New Hampshire, has focused on another theme, the wisdom that can be brought to Washington from those working outside the dysfunctional city. "At this moment you have leadership in D.C. that defines itself by dividing us and subtracting us," he says. "In local communities we still are decent people who are about the politics of addition and multiplication."
Starbucks executive chairman Howard Schultz, a businessman who has long considered a presidential run, has recently started a personal office as he pulls back from day-to-day control of the company. His public speeches drift far afield from the coffee business.
"This is not a time for isolationism, for nationalism," he said Thursday at the Atlantic Council. "This is not a time to build walls. This is a time to build bridges."
The potential candidates preach both national and party unity, decrying the "false choices" between appealing to white Midwestern voters and the more diverse and urban Democratic base. But in the next breath, they sometimes demonstrate how many different routes there are to reach that goal of restitching the Democratic coalition ripped apart by Trump.
"The economy doesn't have a good answer for people who haven't gone to college, and it hasn't had an answer for a long time," explains Center for American Progress president Neera Tanden, who will host at least 10 potential candidates Tuesday for a policy conference. "Trump proved a wrong answer beats no answer."
Late last month, Harris stopped by the the Breakfast Club, one of the biggest morning shows in urban radio, to discuss the importance of blacks voting in the recent victory of Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala. "The math is that a white Democrat won in the south because of black women," she said, simplifying a close election that was turned by many different factors.

A couple weeks earlier, Montana Gov. Steven Bullock, D, traveled the back roads of Iowa, boasting that 20 percent of his voters in 2016 also marked Trump on the same ballot. "I show up, as simple as that is," he said in an interview. "I don't have the luxury of going places where people think exactly like me."
Mayors and governors have been talking up their own liberal records of innovation in the states, aiming to contrast their competence to the dysfunction of Washington. "We have demonstrated that a policy ecosystem of progressive economic development works," said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, D, who has been traveling the country as chair of the Democratic Governors Association. "We have blown up the Republican trickle down message of Donald Trump."
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who is working on a book due out next year, has anchored his pitch in a broad vision of Democrats as "the party of everyday life" - a good job, health care and education included. "We've got to realize that a lot of this has to do with style," he said. "That should be fairly obvious - we have a president who doesn't even have an ideology, only a style."
Others like Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper have begun to speak about the failures of past administrations, as the party struggles to identify an economic message in an age of low unemployment, strong market performance and continued kitchen table insecurity.
"I think we also have to not be afraid to look back with an honest eye," he said, of the effects of global trade. "What happened in the 1990s with outsourcing was really government malpractice. As a country, we didn't deliver for our citizens."
Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who hails from Youngstown, has argued for a focus on the economic threat of China, while cautioning against new government programs that displace the private sector. "We can be hostile to monopolies, oligarchies and concentrations of wealth," he said. "But we can't be hostile to capitalism."
After the 2016 election, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., announced that he had been "humiliated" that the Democratic Party could not appeal to the white working class "where I came from."

Since then, he has tried to focus more on healing the rifts that emerged between him and minority communities. It has been a sometimes rocky road, as when he awkwardly described Obama as a "charismatic individual" during a speech in Mississippi on the anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination.
Sanders says he has been learning since the last campaign. "The situations in African-American communities are obviously very different than they are in Vermont," he said. "What I learned was that we have a criminal justice system that is not only broken, but is significantly racist."
Warren has also been reaching out to the black community in an effort to stamp out the impression, left from the 2016 campaign, that the financial regulatory issues at the core of her life's work are not a central cause of minority communities.
"I know I haven't personally experienced the struggles of African-American families, but I am here to say that no one can ignore what is happening in this country," she said in a recent address to the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network, which began with a discussion of housing policy and ended with her calling out, "Can I have an amen on that?"
Party leaders have also been floating a set of new policy ideas, which go beyond the 2016 promises of expanded health-care coverage, tuition relief for college students and more infrastructure spending. Booker has introduced a bill to both legalize marijuana and expunge the records of those with marijuana possession convictions. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., has put forward a bill that would allow the U.S. Postal Service to take on banking functions, including short-term loans to undermine the costly payday loan industry.
Several potential candidates, including Booker, Gillibrand, Harris and Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., have signed on to a bill that would create a pilot program, offering guaranteed jobs paying at least $15 an hour in 15 high-unemployment communities. Sanders has said he is working on his own version of the same program.
Others have charted more moderate paths. "I love Bernie, but I'm not Bernie Sanders. I don't think 500 billionaires are the reason we're in trouble," Biden said in a speech May 8 at the Brookings Institution, in which he proposed free community college tuition, limits on worker noncompete clauses and efforts to broaden the geographic reach of venture capital.
Most of the potential candidates, including other outsiders such as entrepreneur Mark Cuban, have said they will wait until after the midterm elections to make any announcements about their 2020 plans. "It's not about Donald Trump," Cuban wrote in an email explaining his view of the coming campaign. "He is who he is and everyone knows who he is."
Others, such as Hickenlooper, say they really don't know if they are ready to put their families through the two-year strain of a campaign. For the moment, they still have time to work that out.
"What did St. Teresa say?" Hickenlooper asked rhetorically, referencing a quote often attributed to the saint. " 'There are more tears shed over answered prayers.' "

Gov. Scott To Attend Embassy Opening In Jerusalem
Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter

TALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/AP) â€” There are heightened tensions in Israel ahead of opening the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. 

The controversial move will be made official Monday with a dedication ceremony. Gov. Rick Scott, who is visiting Israel, will be on hand for the ceremony.

Scott backed the decision of President Donald Trump to shift the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The move has ignited Palestinian protests and raised fears of a further outbreak of violence.

Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner will preside over the embassy ceremony on Monday.

Scott has previously made two official trips to Israel, including a trade mission last December. His trip is being paid by the state.

Trump pledges to help Chinese phone maker ZTE 'get back into business'
President Donald Trump pledged on Sunday to help Chinese phone manufacturer ZTE return to business, days after the company said it would cease "major operating activities" because of the U.S. government's recent trade restrictions, a shift in tone for a president who has long accused China of stealing U.S. jobs.
"President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast," Trump tweeted. "Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!"
The comment could presage a reversal of one of the Trump administration's toughest actions to date against a Chinese company. In April, the Commerce Department penalized ZTE for violating a settlement with the U.S. government over illegal shipments to Iran and North Korea. As a result, the Trump administration barred U.S. firms for seven years from exporting critical microchips and other parts to ZTE, the world's fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer.
Lacking those components, ZTE halted operations, stressing in a statement Wednesday that it is "actively communicating with the relevant U.S. government departments in order to facilitate the modification or reversal" of the Commerce Department's order.


            
            
  Trump's tweet comes just days before U.S. officials are planning to meet with Liu He, one of Chinese President Xi Jinping's closest advisers, to discuss the strained trade ties. That meeting is expected to be held in Washington this week or next. Trump's new willingness to try to save ZTE also marks a sharp reversal from current U.S. policy, which had sought to punish the firm for repeatedly failing to make changes in the face of U.S. sanctions. The Treasury Department and the Commerce Department had been strongly aligned against ZTE as recently as several days ago.
It's highly unusual for a president to personally intervene in a regulatory matter and could undercut the leverage of Treasury and Commerce officials seeking to enforce sanctions and trade rules. It could send the signal to foreign leaders that anything can be put on the bargaining table as Trump seeks to cut trade deals.
ZTE's business in the United States has also raised concerns among national security officials. Shortly after Trump's tweet, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., responded, "Our intelligence agencies have warned that ZTE technology and phones pose a major cyber security threat. You should care more about our national security than Chinese jobs."
Meanwhile, Trump is trying to broker a historic agreement with North Korea in an attempt to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. The president has said that his economic approach to China is linked to his national security strategy, and China plays an integral part in any decision made by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.


        
            The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a spokesman for the Commerce Department. A ZTE spokesman also did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Nevertheless, trade tensions between the United States and China remain sky high. Trump has proposed tariffs on as much as $60 billion in Chinese goods, and Beijing has responded in kind, prompting only continued threats from the president, who repeatedly lamented the trade deficit between the two countries during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Recently, though, the Trump administration also has sought to limit the encroachment of Chinese telecommunications firms in the United States. The Defense Department in April ordered military exchanges to cease selling ZTE phones on U.S. bases. And the Federal Communications Commission recently moved toward prohibiting U.S. internet providers that receive federal funds from spending them on equipment made by companies such as Huawei, another major Chinese telecom player.
The U.S. government initially penalized ZTE in 2017, requiring the Chinese telecom giant to pay $1.19 billion to settle charges that it violated U.S. sanctions in selling equipment to Iran and North Korea. As part of the settlement, ZTE also was required to punish employees involved in the matter and tighten its internal monitoring.
But U.S. officials said this year that ZTE didn't discipline all the employees involved in the violations. "This egregious behavior cannot be ignored," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in April.
Trump's international economic policies have been marked by ultimatums and threats that are frequently followed by exemptions and reversals. Foreign leaders often do not know whether he will follow through on something he vows to do or whether he will back down.
For example, he has said that he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, but he has temporarily exempted Canada, Mexico, the European Union and several other countries while leaving China and Japan searching for answers.
His advisers have launched official or unofficial trade discussions with numerous countries, and these talks are wrapped in uncertainty because it is unclear whether Trump will follow through on promises to impose tariffs, even if they might raise prices for U.S. consumers.
But nowhere is the United States' trade relationship as complicated as with China. During the campaign, Trump blasted China for what he alleged was a pattern of cheating through currency devaluation and other measures to steal American jobs and hurt U.S. workers.
The United States buys more than $500 billion in goods from China each year, but Trump has proposed to force China to buy an additional $200 billion in goods from the United States.
Several weeks ago, as tensions between the White House and Beijing escalated, both sides promised to impose increasingly severe trade restrictions on the other, spooking financial markets amid fears of a trade war.
Chinese leaders have tried to resist Trump's demands, but in recent weeks they have shown a willingness to negotiate. The economies are inextricably linked, as China relies on U.S. consumers to buy many of its products, and the United States relies on Chinese producers for a range of goods.
Trump has repeatedly cited a "friendship" with Xi, though they've met only a few times, and he has said that this relationship will endure no matter what happens with the trade talks. One of the biggest sources of tension between the two countries, though, is the allegation that China steals intellectual property from U.S. companies and then retools it for its firms.

            GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) â€” The Gaza Strip is rapidly running out of cooking gas and diesel fuel for hospital generators will only last another 7-10 days, officials said Sunday, after Palestinian protesters destroyed the fuel terminal at the territory's only cargo crossing.


    
                                                
                        
            In Friday night's attack, a large crowd broke into the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing between Gaza and Israel, badly damaging a fuel and gas terminal and a conveyor belt for aggregate and animal feed.


    
                                                                
                                
                
                            
                                        
            Israel closed Kerem Shalom, saying it would take weeks or months to repair several million dollars in damages. It was not clear when the delivery of consumer goods by trucks would resume, said an army spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, adding that six trucks with medical supplies entered Gaza on Sunday.


    
            There has been widespread speculation about the motives for the vandalism, with Israel holding Gaza's rulers from the Islamic militant Hamas group responsible. Friday's attack was the second on Kerem Shalom in a week, raising questions about why Hamas did not try to protect a key installation.


    
            Hamas, which has a tight grip on Gaza, has not commented publicly.


    
            The closure of the vital cargo crossing comes at a tense time in Gaza, which has endured a border blockade by Israel and Egypt since Hamas assumed control of the territory in 2007.


    
                                                
            Since late March, Hamas has organized weekly protests near the border with Israel, in hopes of breaking the blockade. Forty-two protesters have been killed and more than 1,800 wounded by Israeli army fire during the campaign.


    
            On Monday, the largest turnout yet is expected for a protest to coincide with the opening of the U.S. Embassy in contested Jerusalem. The possibility of a mass border breach, floated in recent days by Hamas officials, has raised concerns about large numbers of Palestinian casualties. Israel has said it would prevent a breach at any cost.


    
            The rampage at Kerem Shalom, in the southeastern corner of Gaza, began just as Friday's weekly border protest was wrapping up.


    
            Conricus, the army spokesman, alleged that Hamas "incited the violence that led to the vandalism of the crossing."


    
            An Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with briefing regulations, said Hamas security men were in the area at the time, using communications devices and telling people what to do. He said Israel relayed messages to Hamas to stop the riots and that Hamas refused.


    
            A senior Hamas official confirmed that Hamas security men were in the area, but that they were unable to stop an angry crowd of about 5,000 people. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of he was not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters, estimated the damage at about $10 million.


    
                                                
            The closure of the crossing creates new hardships for Gaza's 2 million people who have endured the fallout from 11 years of blockade, including just a few hours a day of electricity.


    
            With a heavy reliance on generators, a shortage of diesel fuel needed to run them would be sharply felt in Gaza.


    
            Gaza's 13 public hospitals have enough diesel fuel for generators for a week to 10 days, said Mahmoud Daher from the World Health Organization. In 14 clinics run by NGOs, supplies might only last for four or five days, he added.


    
            "Coupled with the existing shortage of medicine and drugs and other materials needed by the health ministry this will add another burden on the already overstretched health sector," he said.


    
            Gaza is also running low on cooking gas, said Samir Hamada, the head of the association of cooking gas vendors.


    
            Gaza needs about 350 tons of cooking gas daily, but only about 300 tons are still available at private sales outlets, he said. Hamas ordered sales to stop to assess the shortage, he said.


    
                                                
            Starting Monday, people can only get their cylinders halfway filled halfway to make the most of the available amounts, he said.

John Bolton says European countries that still deal with Iran may face U.S. sanctions - NY Daily News

Mahathirâ€™s return in Malaysia promises significant change in ties with U.S., China
Special to WorldTribune.com

By GIS/Defense  Foreign Affairs, Kuala Lumpur.

The return to office as Prime Minister of Malaysia of Dr Mahathir Mohamed, 92, on May 10, 2018, was expected to change the tone of affairs both within Malaysia as well as within the region.

Dr Mahathir Mohamad speaks at a press conference after being sworn in as Malaysiaâ€™s seventh Prime Minister on May 10, 2018.
Significantly, it is not Dr Mahathirâ€™s age which was at the core of the changes which were anticipated, although he has indicated that he would hand over the office to his former Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, within â€œa few yearsâ€, and, in the meantime, would ensure a Royal Pardon for Anwar, who was, at the time of the election, still imprisoned on what were seen to be politically-motivated charges.

Malaysians had gone to the polls for the countryâ€™s 14th general election on May 9, 2018, to elect all 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat (Peopleâ€™s Hall) and 505 seats in 12 of the 13 state legislative assemblies.

What was particularly significant in this election was that former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 92, had re-emerged from retirement to contest the election on behalf of the opposition alliance, the Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope), in an attempt to remove his old party, Barisan Nasional (National Front), which dominated the governing UMNO coalition, and its Prime Minister, Najib Razak.

Dr Mahathir cited his anger over the corruption of Prime Minister Najib as his reason to return to politics and on the side of the opposition. UMNO had held 133 seats in the outgoing 13th Parliament, and Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia: PPBM), which was included in the Pakatan Harapan alliance, had 68 seats. What was perhaps more significant was that Pakatan Harapan had been led by Anwar Ibrahim, onetime deputy to then Prime Minister Mahathir, who had been consistently attacked by the UMNO Government, and was still in prison after facing allegations of sodomy.

Dr Mahathir had said that he would hand over the Prime Ministership to Dr Anwar when he was released from prison. Late on election night, even as rioting occurred when it was alleged that Government officials were attempting to introduce fake stuffed ballot boxes into the count, it became clear that Dr Mahathir â€” he had abandoned BN in 2016 â€” had secured more than the 112 seats needed for a majority. His coalition was confirmed to have taken 115 seats, and UMNO took 79 seats (a third party, Gagasan Sejahtera [Ideas of Prosperity, an Islamist party], part of the Malaysian Islamic Party, PAS, took 17 seats). UMNOâ€™s loss marked the first change of power in Malaysia since independence in 1963.

Datuk Seri Wan Azizah binti Wan Ismail, who had been leading the opposition â€” and the presidency of the Peopleâ€™s Justice Party, part of Pakatan Harapan, and husband to Anwar Ibrahim â€” was named Deputy Prime Minister.

The strategic impact of the change of government included the fact that Dr Mahathir promised to scale back the level of former Prime Minister Najib Razakâ€™s commitment to closeness with the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC). This would create minor concerns for Beijing, which had been working with the Najib Government on a range of logistical links bringing the Malay Peninsula into dependency on the PRCâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), such as a proposed new rail link.

This may be a subtle change, but it would open new prospects for better strategic relations between Malaysia and the United States (and its â€œQuadripartiteâ€ partners, Australia, Japan, and possibly India) at a time when the U.S. was, in particular, attempting to claw back influence in the region. [The U.S.-DPRK summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-Un in Singapore on June 12, 2018, was another step by the U.S. to regain influence in the region.]

But, domestically, Prime Minister Mahathir was compelled, and willing, to deliver on his campaign promise to reduce corruption in the Malaysian Government. His credibility in this would depend on how vigorously he prosecuted officials engaged in the 1MDB (1Malaysia Development Berhad) case, the event which may have precipitated the fall of Prime Minister Najibâ€™s UMNO/Barisan Nasional Government. Mr. Najib was accused of diverting more than RM2.67-billion (appr. $700-million) from 1MDB, a government-run strategic development company, to his personal bank accounts.

Once that scandal was investigated, there would be nothing to stop the unraveling of then-Prime Minister Najibâ€™s allegedly illegal dealings with the French Parti Socialiste in the procurement of the Royal Malaysian Navyâ€™s â€œwhite elephantâ€ program to acquire two ScorpÃ¨ne and one Agosta 70 submarines. [This was covered by this service on April 13, 2012, as â€œDefense Procurement: Politicization Without Performance; How the Malaysian Submarine Scandal Could Help Determine the Outcomes of the French and Malaysian Electionsâ€] This scandal reportedly was highly financially beneficial to both Prime Minister Najib and (now) former French President FranÃ§ois Hollande (before he took office).

On April 3, 2013, this report detailed how the RMN would, after all the costs, now dispose of the two ScorpÃ¨nes, quoting Prime Minister Najib as saying â€œThe damn things have never caused us anything but trouble. If we hadnâ€™t bought them, we could have held that stinking election a year ago and Iâ€™d be home and dry by now.â€

So Dr Mahathir would now push the Government to prosecute outgoing Prime Minister Najib and members of his Government. Indeed, Dr Mahathir was stirred to return to government when he saw the degree to which his former party and bloc, Barisan Nasional and the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), had descended into such blatant corruption. The question will be how much of this scandal would lead to officials in France and the PRC.

Vermont Law School to help expunge marijuana misdemeanors
ROYALTON, Vt. (AP) â€” The Vermont Law School plans to help those with misdemeanor marijuana charges in Windsor County expunge their record.

The Valley News reports Windsor County Stateâ€™s Attorney David Cahill and the schoolâ€™s Center for Justice Reform have agreed to help those with charges begin the process of clearing their records at a June 9 event. The announcement comes ahead of the July 1 change in marijuana laws that will allow the possession of small amounts of marijuana.

Felonies or convictions of marijuana sales will not be eligible.


                
                Chittenden County Stateâ€™s Attorney Sarah George will hold a similar event in that county on June 12.
Analysis: Tariffs won't slow China's tech rise
China's aggressive efforts to become a tech superpower have long worried many American business leaders, and now are fueling trade tensions with the United States. But experts say the US government needs to come up with a smarter response.  President Donald Trump is sending his top economic advisers to China this week for talks about the trade dispute in which the two countries have threatened to slap tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each other's exports. 
  
  The US government says it's taking action against China over policies that have enabled Chinese firms to unfairly get their hands on sensitive technology from American companies. At the heart of the concerns is "Made in China 2025," Beijing's plan to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into industries like robotics, electric cars and computing with the aim of becoming a global leader in those areas. 
  Related: China's biggest tech companies have reason to be worried 
  The proposed US tariffs target many products linked to the 2025 plan, but analysts say they are unlikely to make a big difference. 
   Slowing down China's tech development "is not a reasonable goal," said James Lewis, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Instead, the United States needs to focus on getting Beijing to play by the same rules as everyone else, he said. 
  Getting other countries on board 
  America and its allies still have the clout to make that happen, experts say. Chinese companies and researchers need access to Western markets and technology, especially US technology, to continue to advance. 
  "The relationship between China and the US on tech is so deep and so interwoven, it'd be hard to pull it apart," Lewis said. "But [China] is still the junior partner." 
  To pressure China to play by international rules, experts and tech companies argue the US government should put together a united front with allies who are also alarmed by Beijing's industrial policy. 
  "Instead of tariffs, we strongly encourage the administration to build an international coalition that can challenge China at the [World Trade Organization] and beyond," Dean Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council wrote in a letter last month to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, one of the US officials visiting China this week. 
  Related: US business to Trump: Don't go through with China tariffs 
  The trade group -- which represents more than 60 big tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) -- said many countries share the United States' concern about Beijing's unfair trade practices. 
  But Trump's tough line on US trade with other economies, including threatening tariffs on US imports steel and aluminum from allies such as the European Union and Canada, has made building a united front on China a lot harder. 
    
  Rethinking US investment in tech 
  Analysts say China's tech ambitions should also make the US government take a hard look at its own domestic policies. 
  "After decades of doubting China's innovation potential, the United States now fears the rapid pace of China's technological catchup, and sees Chinese technology as a major (perhaps even existential) threat to US economic competitiveness," Matt Sheehan, a fellow at the Paulson Institute, wrote in a blog post last month.Â  
  Related: How China plans to beat the U.S. at technology 
  America is home to the world's leading researchers and universities, and Silicon Valley remains the tech industry's global hub. But the country has fallen behind when it comes to federal funding for science and technology research and development, according to Lewis, the CSIS expert. 
  "China has less money than us but they're willing to spend it," he said. "We need to find a new way to invest in science and tech in the United States." 
  Cracking down on China's shopping spree 
  The US government is also aiming to make it harder for China to get hold of key technology by buying up American companies. 
  Like former President Barack Obama before him, Trump has blocked some Chinese takeovers because of concerns about sensitive technology. 
  On top of that, Trump in March asked Mnuchin to "address concerns about investment in the United States directed or facilitated by China in industries or technologies deemed important to the United States." 
  Related: Chinese investment in the United States dropped 36% last year 
  A senior Treasury official said last month the department is considering using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act as a way to restrict Chinese investment. 
  The Treasury department is also supporting a bill to modernize reviews carried out by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an inter-agency government committee that evaluates sales of US businesses to foreign entities to determine the impact on national security. 
  Beijing's response 
  China is unhappy about the Trump administration's allegations about its trade practices. It has dismissed the findings of the US government's investigation into intellectual property theft as "unfounded." 
  State media outlets are also defending the country's technological prowess. 
  "China's astronautics and aeronautics industries have a strong independent research and development ability," the Global Times, a provocative but  said in an editorial last month. "China has surpassed the US in key areas ... It's unrealistic for the US to block these developments." 
  Related: How much ammo does China have for a trade war? 
  And US moves to stifle Chinese tech companies, such as a recent ban on selling American-made parts to smartphone maker ZTE, are only likely to confirm Beijing's view that it needs to do more to bolster its domestic industries, according to Louis Kuijs, head of Asia for research firm Oxford Economics. 
  "The current US tech-oriented actions against China will lead China to double down its efforts to become technologically independent and develop homegrown technology," he wrote in a research note last week.

Saudi military says troops arrive in Yemenâ€™s Socotra island
by Associated Press  by Associated Press  May 13 at 1:44 PM  
  CAIRO â€” A Saudi military spokesman says that its troops have landed on the Yemeni island of Socotra, listed by UNESCO as a world natural heritage site and the focus of a dispute between Yemen and its ally the United Arab Emirates.
 Turki al-Malki, spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemenâ€™s Shiite rebels, says Sunday that the Saudi troops are on a training and support mission for Yemeni forces.
 He adds that the Saudis, Emiratis and Yemenis will conduct joint training exercises in coordination with the Yemeni government.
 The UAE is a major pillar in the Saudi-led coalition. But their alleged deployment of its troops to the island earlier this month without prior consultation with Yemenâ€™s exiled government stoked the ire of Yemeni locals.

Congresswoman Kristi Noemâ€™s Weekly Column: No Matter the Call
No Matter the Call

By Rep. Kristi Noem

I am incredibly grateful for the work of South Dakotaâ€™s law enforcement officers. The job has never been easy, but with violent crime on the rise, a growing drug epidemic, and a looming mental health crisis, more is being asked of our men and women in blue than ever before.

Between 2005 and 2015, South Dakotaâ€™s violent crime rate doubled. Drug arrests are up. Aggravated assault and domestic violence is increasing. Sioux Falls has become more dangerous than Fargo, North Dakota, or Omaha, Nebraska. And people are feeling the impact. I hear all the time how our communities just donâ€™t feel like they did 15 years ago; they feel less safe.

When President Trump was sworn in last year, he brought his profound respect for law enforcement into the Oval Office. Together, weâ€™ve increased support for those in blue. For instance, we expanded Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grants, which are used for hiring and training police officers and have provided $13 million in funding to South Dakota law enforcement in the last five years.

In South Dakota, much of the drain on our resources comes from a growing drug epidemic. In recent months, Governor Daugaard declared that meth use in South Dakota was at epidemic levels. Opioid abuse is on the rise as well. While I believe prevention is key, I introduced a set of bills to strengthen families during drug addiction treatment and amplify efforts to prevent the child abuse and neglect that can result from drug use.

Additionally, Iâ€™m working to cut off drugs at their source. President Trumpâ€™s border wall is critical to stemming illegal drug trafficking, and Iâ€™ve voted to fully fund his proposal. Iâ€™m also working on legislation to crack down on Mexican drug traffickers and those who help facilitate their illicit activities at the border.

Moreover, we need to fix the quirks in the law that make law enforcement jobs harder, which is what my CUFF Act intends to do. The bill is commonsense: it prohibits individuals with outstanding felony warrants or parole violations from receiving certain Social Security benefits. Itâ€™s not only unfair to ask taxpayers to pay people who are fleeing the law, but itâ€™s self-defeating to subsidize someoneâ€™s attempt to shirk law enforcement. As Staci Ackerman, Executive Director of the South Dakota Sheriffsâ€™ Association said, the bill would â€œlimit [a wanted felon or parole violatorâ€™s] ability to avoid justice using taxpayer dollars to evade capture.â€ This bill was passed in the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate.

Each of these tools aim to help law enforcement do their job better and more safely. This, in turn, keeps our communities safer. As we mark National Police Week on May 13 through 19, I ask that you find a way to thank the heroes who protect us every day as well as their families, who often wait anxiously for their loved one to return home each shift, not knowing what situations they faced that day.

Finally, on behalf of my family and I, please know that weâ€™re praying for you and for your safety. I admire the work of our law enforcement officers and the courage required to respond no matter the call.

Mahathirâ€™s return in Malaysia promises significant change in ties with U.S., China
Special to WorldTribune.com

By GIS/Defense  Foreign Affairs, Kuala Lumpur.

The return to office as Prime Minister of Malaysia of Dr Mahathir Mohamed, 92, on May 10, 2018, was expected to change the tone of affairs both within Malaysia as well as within the region.

Dr Mahathir Mohamad speaks at a press conference after being sworn in as Malaysiaâ€™s seventh Prime Minister on May 10, 2018.
Significantly, it is not Dr Mahathirâ€™s age which was at the core of the changes which were anticipated, although he has indicated that he would hand over the office to his former Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, within â€œa few yearsâ€, and, in the meantime, would ensure a Royal Pardon for Anwar, who was, at the time of the election, still imprisoned on what were seen to be politically-motivated charges.

Malaysians had gone to the polls for the countryâ€™s 14th general election on May 9, 2018, to elect all 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat (Peopleâ€™s Hall) and 505 seats in 12 of the 13 state legislative assemblies.

What was particularly significant in this election was that former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 92, had re-emerged from retirement to contest the election on behalf of the opposition alliance, the Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope), in an attempt to remove his old party, Barisan Nasional (National Front), which dominated the governing UMNO coalition, and its Prime Minister, Najib Razak.

Dr Mahathir cited his anger over the corruption of Prime Minister Najib as his reason to return to politics and on the side of the opposition. UMNO had held 133 seats in the outgoing 13th Parliament, and Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia: PPBM), which was included in the Pakatan Harapan alliance, had 68 seats. What was perhaps more significant was that Pakatan Harapan had been led by Anwar Ibrahim, onetime deputy to then Prime Minister Mahathir, who had been consistently attacked by the UMNO Government, and was still in prison after facing allegations of sodomy.

Dr Mahathir had said that he would hand over the Prime Ministership to Dr Anwar when he was released from prison. Late on election night, even as rioting occurred when it was alleged that Government officials were attempting to introduce fake stuffed ballot boxes into the count, it became clear that Dr Mahathir â€” he had abandoned BN in 2016 â€” had secured more than the 112 seats needed for a majority. His coalition was confirmed to have taken 115 seats, and UMNO took 79 seats (a third party, Gagasan Sejahtera [Ideas of Prosperity, an Islamist party], part of the Malaysian Islamic Party, PAS, took 17 seats). UMNOâ€™s loss marked the first change of power in Malaysia since independence in 1963.

Datuk Seri Wan Azizah binti Wan Ismail, who had been leading the opposition â€” and the presidency of the Peopleâ€™s Justice Party, part of Pakatan Harapan, and husband to Anwar Ibrahim â€” was named Deputy Prime Minister.

The strategic impact of the change of government included the fact that Dr Mahathir promised to scale back the level of former Prime Minister Najib Razakâ€™s commitment to closeness with the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC). This would create minor concerns for Beijing, which had been working with the Najib Government on a range of logistical links bringing the Malay Peninsula into dependency on the PRCâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), such as a proposed new rail link.

This may be a subtle change, but it would open new prospects for better strategic relations between Malaysia and the United States (and its â€œQuadripartiteâ€ partners, Australia, Japan, and possibly India) at a time when the U.S. was, in particular, attempting to claw back influence in the region. [The U.S.-DPRK summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-Un in Singapore on June 12, 2018, was another step by the U.S. to regain influence in the region.]

But, domestically, Prime Minister Mahathir was compelled, and willing, to deliver on his campaign promise to reduce corruption in the Malaysian Government. His credibility in this would depend on how vigorously he prosecuted officials engaged in the 1MDB (1Malaysia Development Berhad) case, the event which may have precipitated the fall of Prime Minister Najibâ€™s UMNO/Barisan Nasional Government. Mr. Najib was accused of diverting more than RM2.67-billion (appr. $700-million) from 1MDB, a government-run strategic development company, to his personal bank accounts.

Once that scandal was investigated, there would be nothing to stop the unraveling of then-Prime Minister Najibâ€™s allegedly illegal dealings with the French Parti Socialiste in the procurement of the Royal Malaysian Navyâ€™s â€œwhite elephantâ€ program to acquire two ScorpÃ¨ne and one Agosta 70 submarines. [This was covered by this service on April 13, 2012, as â€œDefense Procurement: Politicization Without Performance; How the Malaysian Submarine Scandal Could Help Determine the Outcomes of the French and Malaysian Electionsâ€] This scandal reportedly was highly financially beneficial to both Prime Minister Najib and (now) former French President FranÃ§ois Hollande (before he took office).

On April 3, 2013, this report detailed how the RMN would, after all the costs, now dispose of the two ScorpÃ¨nes, quoting Prime Minister Najib as saying â€œThe damn things have never caused us anything but trouble. If we hadnâ€™t bought them, we could have held that stinking election a year ago and Iâ€™d be home and dry by now.â€

So Dr Mahathir would now push the Government to prosecute outgoing Prime Minister Najib and members of his Government. Indeed, Dr Mahathir was stirred to return to government when he saw the degree to which his former party and bloc, Barisan Nasional and the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), had descended into such blatant corruption. The question will be how much of this scandal would lead to officials in France and the PRC.

Saudi military says troops arrive in Yemenâ€™s Socotra island
by Associated Press  by Associated Press  May 13 at 1:44 PM  
  CAIRO â€” A Saudi military spokesman says that its troops have landed on the Yemeni island of Socotra, listed by UNESCO as a world natural heritage site and the focus of a dispute between Yemen and its ally the United Arab Emirates.
 Turki al-Malki, spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemenâ€™s Shiite rebels, says Sunday that the Saudi troops are on a training and support mission for Yemeni forces.
 He adds that the Saudis, Emiratis and Yemenis will conduct joint training exercises in coordination with the Yemeni government.
 The UAE is a major pillar in the Saudi-led coalition. But their alleged deployment of its troops to the island earlier this month without prior consultation with Yemenâ€™s exiled government stoked the ire of Yemeni locals.
