Putin’s stock rises as 'go-to' mediator between Israel, Iran
Russian diplomacy shifts into high gear
Following the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Russian President Vladimir Putin may be the best bet, or last man standing, to offer a diplomatic off-ramp for Israel and Iran to avoid war.


Two weeks ago, this column observed that Russia might be well-placed as a potential mediator between Iran and Israel, a trend Al-Monitor has followed for over four years. That role places Putin on a tightrope balancing Russia’s all-in support for the Syrian government, while facing the limits of Moscow’s uneasy but vital relationships with both Iran and Israel and reckoning with a continued slide in US-Russia relations. The regional picture is additionally complicated by the US decision to relocate its embassy to Jerusalem, the Palestinian demonstrations in the Gaza Strip, the absence of an Israeli-Palestinian diplomatic track and Hezbollah’s win in Lebanon’s elections.


The events of the past week reflect this new direction and urgency in Putin’s approach to the region. On May 8, the Russian Foreign Ministry slammed Trump’s decision on the JCPOA as “new confirmation of Washington’s intractability. They also show that the US objections to Iran’s absolutely legal nuclear activity are nothing but a smokescreen for settling political scores with Iran,” adding that “Russia is open to further cooperation with the other JCPOA participants and will continue to actively develop bilateral collaboration and political dialogue with the Islamic Republic of Iran.” The next day Moscow slammed new US sanctions on Russia “allegedly for violating the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act, which has no connection to Russia. In effect, this US decision has been precipitated by a trivial desire to get even with Russia over the failed missile attack on Syria, which the United States, Britain and France launched on April 14 in violation of international law."


Perhaps most telling of Putin’s diplomatic turn was the visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Moscow on May 9. Netanyahu was accorded a seat of honor on the occasion of Victory Day, which commemorates the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The Israeli prime minister gave a moving testimonial to the sacrifices of Russian soldiers in liberating the Auschwitz concentration camp.


Netanyahu claimed that he was able to persuade Putin to delay the sale of advanced weapons, including S-300 missiles to Syria. Israeli warplanes struck Iranian military targets inside Syria on May 10, the very next day, suggesting that Netanyahu may have given Putin advance notice of the attack. The Russian reaction to the incident was muted, while highlighting Russian mediation. “In our contacts with Iranian and Israeli leaders, including at the May 9 meeting between President of Russia Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, we have repeatedly noted the need for both sides to avoid any actions that would provoke the other,” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “Iran and Israel assure us that they have no such intentions, but, as you know, incidents, nevertheless, happen. It is particularly alarming that they occur despite the fact that all of us have underscored our commitment to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria.”


Also on May 10, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov met with Iran's deputy foreign minister for political affairs, Abbas Araghchi, in Tehran. Putin himself worked the phones, speaking with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.


Maxim Suchkov explains that “Netanyahu understands he can’t sway Russia from its position opposing the US exit from the nuclear Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Therefore, while with Trump, Netanyahu sought to arm the US president with arguments for leaving the JCPOA, but with Putin, Netanyahu seeks to expose the ‘malignant nature of the Iranian regime’ and thus legitimize Israeli efforts at countering it. The latter is a hard sell with the Kremlin, but Netanyahu hopes that there is a chance that if Russia has heard the essence of Israeli concerns, Putin would be (a) more persuasive with Iran on its actions in Syria and (b) have a higher tolerance level for Israeli’s actions in Syria, and perhaps against Hezbollah in Lebanon.”


Suchkov reports that there is a deconfliction "hotline" between the Russian Khmeimim air base in Syria and the Israeli Kirya command center in Tel Aviv, and concludes that “while the parties still seek to lure Moscow to their own camp, they are also discovering that Russia’s role as the only ‘go-to’ entity for bilateral ‘matters of life and death’ might just be beneficial for them all. Therefore, whereas Putin may have genuine empathy for Netanyahu’s concerns and sincerely appreciate his symbolic overtures, he’d still be interested in listening to the opposite camp and measuring the recent moods in Damascus and Tehran. In this regard, one shouldn’t be surprised to see a high-level visitor or two from Syria or Iran to Russia rather soon.”


Turkish president tells Rouhani US decision on JCPOA is "wrong"


Erdogan said the United States will be the loser from the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the JCPOA while telling his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, that the US decision is “wrong.” Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said, “We do not wish the Iranian people to be negatively affected by these sanctions and we won’t hesitate to do our part if we’re to do something about them.”


Amberin Zaman writes that the “the timing of the US withdrawal [from the JCPOA] will have shifted Turkish conspiracy thinking into even higher gear.”


Zaman explains, “Iran is among Turkey’s top suppliers of oil and natural gas and a vital land bridge for Turkish truckers carrying goods to Central Asia. They are unable to access the region via neighboring Armenia, a far shorter route, because of Ankara’s refusal to open its borders with the former Soviet republic out of solidarity with Armenia’s top enemy Azerbaijan. The longtime regional rivals share a porous mountainous border and a common fear of Kurdish separatists active on both sides. The fear of Kurdish gains overseen by US forces in northern Syria has propelled Iran and Turkey into shelving their differences over the Syrian regime and their respective claims of leading Shiite and Sunni Muslims and forming an alliance with Russia.”


Adding to Turkish conspiratorial thinking is that “the decision comes as a federal court in Manhattan prepares to sentence Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Turkish banker accused of involvement in a Byzantine scheme that saw Turkey’s state-owned Halkbank allegedly conspiring with now jailed Iranian-Turkish gold trader Reza Zarrab to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through the US financial system on behalf of Iran. Erdogan and assorted Turkish officials have long charged that the case is part of a global plot to undermine Turkey. Meanwhile, Turkish businessmen nervously await the scale of an expected fine to be levied on Halkbank by the US Treasury and its likely effects on Turkey’s wobbly finances.”


Erdogan’s bravado may obscure alarm over the potential impact on Turkey of the renewal of US secondary sanctions on Iran. Fehim Tastekin reports, “Although some analysts think the new sanctions will not affect trading with Iran, some are predicting much tougher days ahead. Turkey — which had taken advantage of some tolerance by the United States earlier — is this time under strict surveillance, accused of breaking the original sanctions via Turkey’s state-owned Halkbank.”


Tastekin adds, “Turkish-American political relations have become much more complex. The United States' patience might be short now that Turkey has agreed to buy S-400 missile defense systems from Russia despite NATO’s reservations. The US Congress is also unhappy with Ankara because of Turkey's continuing detention of American missionary Andrew Brunson. Even if Trump includes exemptions for Turkey from the secondary sanctions, that may not win the approval of Congress.” 


Tastekin continues, “A group in the AKP wants Ankara to revert to the US-Israel axis because of economic threats Turkey is facing, while another group demands ‘resistance’ to the United States. But the prevailing opinion is that this time, the Turkish government may not support Iran.” 


Some of this may have to do with the value of their banknotes. “Now both sides must be ready for disappointment regarding their hope of using local currencies in their trade, as both Turkey's lira and Iran's rial weaken against the dollar, and the business world will not find it wise to use them in their transactions,” Tastekin concludes. “Turkey now faces a tough period. Which way its relations go with Iran will depend on the new list of US exemptions and whether Ankara can maintain its supportive attitude toward Tehran.”

Former Obama aide ‘speechless’ at Trump reversal on ZTE
A former aide under the Obama administration said he was surprised on Sunday by President TrumpDonald John TrumpUS paid Trump's Scottish resort for VIP hotel stays: report Michael Avenatti tweets, then deletes, Fox News booker's phone number Former Trump aide working with Russian company to lift US sanctions: report MORE’s announcement that he is working with China to help Chinese telecommunications equipment-maker ZTE get “back into business,” according to the Financial Times.
“I am speechless,” said Kevin Wolf, who was assistant secretary of commerce under President Obama.
Telecom giant ZTE is the fourth-largest phone vendor in the U.S. But, last month, the company was slapped with an export ban from the Commerce Department after the U.S. said it had violated a deal by circumventing sanctions against Iran and North Korea.
Wolf, who oversaw the beginning of the ZTE case during his time in the Obama administration told the Financial Times, “I’m highly confident that a [U.S.] president has never intervened in a law-enforcement matter like this before … It’s so outside the way the rules were set up.”  
Trump said on Sunday morning via Twitter that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to help boost ZTE. He added that too many jobs in China were lost because of ZTE’s issues and said he has instructed the Commerce Department to “get it done.”
President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 13, 2018Trump’s support for ZTE marks a departure from previous actions the White House and the federal government have taken against the company. Trump's comments also represent the second time in the past month that his administration has rolled back sanctions against a foreign company.
ZTE and competitor Huawei have routinely been scrutinized by regulators concerned that their products could pose a national security threat. 
The Justice Department has largely focused on sanctions violations while Congress has previously taken action against Chinese companies under the pretext of national security.
In Congress, lawmakers have pushed U.S. firms to distance themselves from Chinese companies, leading efforts to enact legislation barring the U.S. government from using products of companies such as Huawei, ZTE and others.
ZTE has reportedly been crippled by the ban because of its reliance on U.S. companies that provide critical supplies for its products. The company has submitted a formal request for the Commerce Department to stay the order that keeps American companies from selling it supplies.
Congresswoman Kristi Noem’s Weekly Column: No Matter the Call
No Matter the Call

By Rep. Kristi Noem

I am incredibly grateful for the work of South Dakota’s law enforcement officers. The job has never been easy, but with violent crime on the rise, a growing drug epidemic, and a looming mental health crisis, more is being asked of our men and women in blue than ever before.

Between 2005 and 2015, South Dakota’s violent crime rate doubled. Drug arrests are up. Aggravated assault and domestic violence is increasing. Sioux Falls has become more dangerous than Fargo, North Dakota, or Omaha, Nebraska. And people are feeling the impact. I hear all the time how our communities just don’t feel like they did 15 years ago; they feel less safe.

When President Trump was sworn in last year, he brought his profound respect for law enforcement into the Oval Office. Together, we’ve increased support for those in blue. For instance, we expanded Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grants, which are used for hiring and training police officers and have provided $13 million in funding to South Dakota law enforcement in the last five years.

In South Dakota, much of the drain on our resources comes from a growing drug epidemic. In recent months, Governor Daugaard declared that meth use in South Dakota was at epidemic levels. Opioid abuse is on the rise as well. While I believe prevention is key, I introduced a set of bills to strengthen families during drug addiction treatment and amplify efforts to prevent the child abuse and neglect that can result from drug use.

Additionally, I’m working to cut off drugs at their source. President Trump’s border wall is critical to stemming illegal drug trafficking, and I’ve voted to fully fund his proposal. I’m also working on legislation to crack down on Mexican drug traffickers and those who help facilitate their illicit activities at the border.

Moreover, we need to fix the quirks in the law that make law enforcement jobs harder, which is what my CUFF Act intends to do. The bill is commonsense: it prohibits individuals with outstanding felony warrants or parole violations from receiving certain Social Security benefits. It’s not only unfair to ask taxpayers to pay people who are fleeing the law, but it’s self-defeating to subsidize someone’s attempt to shirk law enforcement. As Staci Ackerman, Executive Director of the South Dakota Sheriffs’ Association said, the bill would “limit [a wanted felon or parole violator’s] ability to avoid justice using taxpayer dollars to evade capture.” This bill was passed in the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate.

Each of these tools aim to help law enforcement do their job better and more safely. This, in turn, keeps our communities safer. As we mark National Police Week on May 13 through 19, I ask that you find a way to thank the heroes who protect us every day as well as their families, who often wait anxiously for their loved one to return home each shift, not knowing what situations they faced that day.

Finally, on behalf of my family and I, please know that we’re praying for you and for your safety. I admire the work of our law enforcement officers and the courage required to respond no matter the call.

Gov. Scott To Attend Embassy Opening In Jerusalem
Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter

TALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/AP) — There are heightened tensions in Israel ahead of opening the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. 

The controversial move will be made official Monday with a dedication ceremony. Gov. Rick Scott, who is visiting Israel, will be on hand for the ceremony.

Scott backed the decision of President Donald Trump to shift the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The move has ignited Palestinian protests and raised fears of a further outbreak of violence.

Trump’s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner will preside over the embassy ceremony on Monday.

Scott has previously made two official trips to Israel, including a trade mission last December. His trip is being paid by the state.

Trump pledges to help Chinese phone maker ZTE 'get back into business'
President Donald Trump pledged on Sunday to help Chinese phone manufacturer ZTE return to business, days after the company said it would cease "major operating activities" because of the U.S. government's recent trade restrictions, a shift in tone for a president who has long accused China of stealing U.S. jobs.
"President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast," Trump tweeted. "Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!"
The comment could presage a reversal of one of the Trump administration's toughest actions to date against a Chinese company. In April, the Commerce Department penalized ZTE for violating a settlement with the U.S. government over illegal shipments to Iran and North Korea. As a result, the Trump administration barred U.S. firms for seven years from exporting critical microchips and other parts to ZTE, the world's fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer.
Lacking those components, ZTE halted operations, stressing in a statement Wednesday that it is "actively communicating with the relevant U.S. government departments in order to facilitate the modification or reversal" of the Commerce Department's order.


            
            
  Trump's tweet comes just days before U.S. officials are planning to meet with Liu He, one of Chinese President Xi Jinping's closest advisers, to discuss the strained trade ties. That meeting is expected to be held in Washington this week or next. Trump's new willingness to try to save ZTE also marks a sharp reversal from current U.S. policy, which had sought to punish the firm for repeatedly failing to make changes in the face of U.S. sanctions. The Treasury Department and the Commerce Department had been strongly aligned against ZTE as recently as several days ago.
It's highly unusual for a president to personally intervene in a regulatory matter and could undercut the leverage of Treasury and Commerce officials seeking to enforce sanctions and trade rules. It could send the signal to foreign leaders that anything can be put on the bargaining table as Trump seeks to cut trade deals.
ZTE's business in the United States has also raised concerns among national security officials. Shortly after Trump's tweet, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., responded, "Our intelligence agencies have warned that ZTE technology and phones pose a major cyber security threat. You should care more about our national security than Chinese jobs."
Meanwhile, Trump is trying to broker a historic agreement with North Korea in an attempt to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. The president has said that his economic approach to China is linked to his national security strategy, and China plays an integral part in any decision made by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.


        
            The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a spokesman for the Commerce Department. A ZTE spokesman also did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Nevertheless, trade tensions between the United States and China remain sky high. Trump has proposed tariffs on as much as $60 billion in Chinese goods, and Beijing has responded in kind, prompting only continued threats from the president, who repeatedly lamented the trade deficit between the two countries during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Recently, though, the Trump administration also has sought to limit the encroachment of Chinese telecommunications firms in the United States. The Defense Department in April ordered military exchanges to cease selling ZTE phones on U.S. bases. And the Federal Communications Commission recently moved toward prohibiting U.S. internet providers that receive federal funds from spending them on equipment made by companies such as Huawei, another major Chinese telecom player.
The U.S. government initially penalized ZTE in 2017, requiring the Chinese telecom giant to pay $1.19 billion to settle charges that it violated U.S. sanctions in selling equipment to Iran and North Korea. As part of the settlement, ZTE also was required to punish employees involved in the matter and tighten its internal monitoring.
But U.S. officials said this year that ZTE didn't discipline all the employees involved in the violations. "This egregious behavior cannot be ignored," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in April.
Trump's international economic policies have been marked by ultimatums and threats that are frequently followed by exemptions and reversals. Foreign leaders often do not know whether he will follow through on something he vows to do or whether he will back down.
For example, he has said that he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, but he has temporarily exempted Canada, Mexico, the European Union and several other countries while leaving China and Japan searching for answers.
His advisers have launched official or unofficial trade discussions with numerous countries, and these talks are wrapped in uncertainty because it is unclear whether Trump will follow through on promises to impose tariffs, even if they might raise prices for U.S. consumers.
But nowhere is the United States' trade relationship as complicated as with China. During the campaign, Trump blasted China for what he alleged was a pattern of cheating through currency devaluation and other measures to steal American jobs and hurt U.S. workers.
The United States buys more than $500 billion in goods from China each year, but Trump has proposed to force China to buy an additional $200 billion in goods from the United States.
Several weeks ago, as tensions between the White House and Beijing escalated, both sides promised to impose increasingly severe trade restrictions on the other, spooking financial markets amid fears of a trade war.
Chinese leaders have tried to resist Trump's demands, but in recent weeks they have shown a willingness to negotiate. The economies are inextricably linked, as China relies on U.S. consumers to buy many of its products, and the United States relies on Chinese producers for a range of goods.
Trump has repeatedly cited a "friendship" with Xi, though they've met only a few times, and he has said that this relationship will endure no matter what happens with the trade talks. One of the biggest sources of tension between the two countries, though, is the allegation that China steals intellectual property from U.S. companies and then retools it for its firms.

            GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Gaza Strip is rapidly running out of cooking gas and diesel fuel for hospital generators will only last another 7-10 days, officials said Sunday, after Palestinian protesters destroyed the fuel terminal at the territory's only cargo crossing.


    
                                                
                        
            In Friday night's attack, a large crowd broke into the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing between Gaza and Israel, badly damaging a fuel and gas terminal and a conveyor belt for aggregate and animal feed.


    
                                                                
                                
                
                            
                                        
            Israel closed Kerem Shalom, saying it would take weeks or months to repair several million dollars in damages. It was not clear when the delivery of consumer goods by trucks would resume, said an army spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, adding that six trucks with medical supplies entered Gaza on Sunday.


    
            There has been widespread speculation about the motives for the vandalism, with Israel holding Gaza's rulers from the Islamic militant Hamas group responsible. Friday's attack was the second on Kerem Shalom in a week, raising questions about why Hamas did not try to protect a key installation.


    
            Hamas, which has a tight grip on Gaza, has not commented publicly.


    
            The closure of the vital cargo crossing comes at a tense time in Gaza, which has endured a border blockade by Israel and Egypt since Hamas assumed control of the territory in 2007.


    
                                                
            Since late March, Hamas has organized weekly protests near the border with Israel, in hopes of breaking the blockade. Forty-two protesters have been killed and more than 1,800 wounded by Israeli army fire during the campaign.


    
            On Monday, the largest turnout yet is expected for a protest to coincide with the opening of the U.S. Embassy in contested Jerusalem. The possibility of a mass border breach, floated in recent days by Hamas officials, has raised concerns about large numbers of Palestinian casualties. Israel has said it would prevent a breach at any cost.


    
            The rampage at Kerem Shalom, in the southeastern corner of Gaza, began just as Friday's weekly border protest was wrapping up.


    
            Conricus, the army spokesman, alleged that Hamas "incited the violence that led to the vandalism of the crossing."


    
            An Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with briefing regulations, said Hamas security men were in the area at the time, using communications devices and telling people what to do. He said Israel relayed messages to Hamas to stop the riots and that Hamas refused.


    
            A senior Hamas official confirmed that Hamas security men were in the area, but that they were unable to stop an angry crowd of about 5,000 people. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of he was not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters, estimated the damage at about $10 million.


    
                                                
            The closure of the crossing creates new hardships for Gaza's 2 million people who have endured the fallout from 11 years of blockade, including just a few hours a day of electricity.


    
            With a heavy reliance on generators, a shortage of diesel fuel needed to run them would be sharply felt in Gaza.


    
            Gaza's 13 public hospitals have enough diesel fuel for generators for a week to 10 days, said Mahmoud Daher from the World Health Organization. In 14 clinics run by NGOs, supplies might only last for four or five days, he added.


    
            "Coupled with the existing shortage of medicine and drugs and other materials needed by the health ministry this will add another burden on the already overstretched health sector," he said.


    
            Gaza is also running low on cooking gas, said Samir Hamada, the head of the association of cooking gas vendors.


    
            Gaza needs about 350 tons of cooking gas daily, but only about 300 tons are still available at private sales outlets, he said. Hamas ordered sales to stop to assess the shortage, he said.


    
                                                
            Starting Monday, people can only get their cylinders halfway filled halfway to make the most of the available amounts, he said.

John Bolton says European countries that still deal with Iran may face U.S. sanctions - NY Daily News

Mahathir’s return in Malaysia promises significant change in ties with U.S., China
Special to WorldTribune.com

By GIS/Defense  Foreign Affairs, Kuala Lumpur.

The return to office as Prime Minister of Malaysia of Dr Mahathir Mohamed, 92, on May 10, 2018, was expected to change the tone of affairs both within Malaysia as well as within the region.

Dr Mahathir Mohamad speaks at a press conference after being sworn in as Malaysia’s seventh Prime Minister on May 10, 2018.
Significantly, it is not Dr Mahathir’s age which was at the core of the changes which were anticipated, although he has indicated that he would hand over the office to his former Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, within “a few years”, and, in the meantime, would ensure a Royal Pardon for Anwar, who was, at the time of the election, still imprisoned on what were seen to be politically-motivated charges.

Malaysians had gone to the polls for the country’s 14th general election on May 9, 2018, to elect all 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat (People’s Hall) and 505 seats in 12 of the 13 state legislative assemblies.

What was particularly significant in this election was that former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 92, had re-emerged from retirement to contest the election on behalf of the opposition alliance, the Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope), in an attempt to remove his old party, Barisan Nasional (National Front), which dominated the governing UMNO coalition, and its Prime Minister, Najib Razak.

Dr Mahathir cited his anger over the corruption of Prime Minister Najib as his reason to return to politics and on the side of the opposition. UMNO had held 133 seats in the outgoing 13th Parliament, and Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia: PPBM), which was included in the Pakatan Harapan alliance, had 68 seats. What was perhaps more significant was that Pakatan Harapan had been led by Anwar Ibrahim, onetime deputy to then Prime Minister Mahathir, who had been consistently attacked by the UMNO Government, and was still in prison after facing allegations of sodomy.

Dr Mahathir had said that he would hand over the Prime Ministership to Dr Anwar when he was released from prison. Late on election night, even as rioting occurred when it was alleged that Government officials were attempting to introduce fake stuffed ballot boxes into the count, it became clear that Dr Mahathir — he had abandoned BN in 2016 — had secured more than the 112 seats needed for a majority. His coalition was confirmed to have taken 115 seats, and UMNO took 79 seats (a third party, Gagasan Sejahtera [Ideas of Prosperity, an Islamist party], part of the Malaysian Islamic Party, PAS, took 17 seats). UMNO’s loss marked the first change of power in Malaysia since independence in 1963.

Datuk Seri Wan Azizah binti Wan Ismail, who had been leading the opposition — and the presidency of the People’s Justice Party, part of Pakatan Harapan, and husband to Anwar Ibrahim — was named Deputy Prime Minister.

The strategic impact of the change of government included the fact that Dr Mahathir promised to scale back the level of former Prime Minister Najib Razak’s commitment to closeness with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). This would create minor concerns for Beijing, which had been working with the Najib Government on a range of logistical links bringing the Malay Peninsula into dependency on the PRC’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), such as a proposed new rail link.

This may be a subtle change, but it would open new prospects for better strategic relations between Malaysia and the United States (and its “Quadripartite” partners, Australia, Japan, and possibly India) at a time when the U.S. was, in particular, attempting to claw back influence in the region. [The U.S.-DPRK summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-Un in Singapore on June 12, 2018, was another step by the U.S. to regain influence in the region.]

But, domestically, Prime Minister Mahathir was compelled, and willing, to deliver on his campaign promise to reduce corruption in the Malaysian Government. His credibility in this would depend on how vigorously he prosecuted officials engaged in the 1MDB (1Malaysia Development Berhad) case, the event which may have precipitated the fall of Prime Minister Najib’s UMNO/Barisan Nasional Government. Mr. Najib was accused of diverting more than RM2.67-billion (appr. $700-million) from 1MDB, a government-run strategic development company, to his personal bank accounts.

Once that scandal was investigated, there would be nothing to stop the unraveling of then-Prime Minister Najib’s allegedly illegal dealings with the French Parti Socialiste in the procurement of the Royal Malaysian Navy’s “white elephant” program to acquire two Scorpène and one Agosta 70 submarines. [This was covered by this service on April 13, 2012, as “Defense Procurement: Politicization Without Performance; How the Malaysian Submarine Scandal Could Help Determine the Outcomes of the French and Malaysian Elections”] This scandal reportedly was highly financially beneficial to both Prime Minister Najib and (now) former French President François Hollande (before he took office).

On April 3, 2013, this report detailed how the RMN would, after all the costs, now dispose of the two Scorpènes, quoting Prime Minister Najib as saying “The damn things have never caused us anything but trouble. If we hadn’t bought them, we could have held that stinking election a year ago and I’d be home and dry by now.”

So Dr Mahathir would now push the Government to prosecute outgoing Prime Minister Najib and members of his Government. Indeed, Dr Mahathir was stirred to return to government when he saw the degree to which his former party and bloc, Barisan Nasional and the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), had descended into such blatant corruption. The question will be how much of this scandal would lead to officials in France and the PRC.

Putin’s stock rises as 'go-to' mediator between Israel, Iran
Russian diplomacy shifts into high gear
Following the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Russian President Vladimir Putin may be the best bet, or last man standing, to offer a diplomatic off-ramp for Israel and Iran to avoid war.


Two weeks ago, this column observed that Russia might be well-placed as a potential mediator between Iran and Israel, a trend Al-Monitor has followed for over four years. That role places Putin on a tightrope balancing Russia’s all-in support for the Syrian government, while facing the limits of Moscow’s uneasy but vital relationships with both Iran and Israel and reckoning with a continued slide in US-Russia relations. The regional picture is additionally complicated by the US decision to relocate its embassy to Jerusalem, the Palestinian demonstrations in the Gaza Strip, the absence of an Israeli-Palestinian diplomatic track and Hezbollah’s win in Lebanon’s elections.


The events of the past week reflect this new direction and urgency in Putin’s approach to the region. On May 8, the Russian Foreign Ministry slammed Trump’s decision on the JCPOA as “new confirmation of Washington’s intractability. They also show that the US objections to Iran’s absolutely legal nuclear activity are nothing but a smokescreen for settling political scores with Iran,” adding that “Russia is open to further cooperation with the other JCPOA participants and will continue to actively develop bilateral collaboration and political dialogue with the Islamic Republic of Iran.” The next day Moscow slammed new US sanctions on Russia “allegedly for violating the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act, which has no connection to Russia. In effect, this US decision has been precipitated by a trivial desire to get even with Russia over the failed missile attack on Syria, which the United States, Britain and France launched on April 14 in violation of international law."


Perhaps most telling of Putin’s diplomatic turn was the visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Moscow on May 9. Netanyahu was accorded a seat of honor on the occasion of Victory Day, which commemorates the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The Israeli prime minister gave a moving testimonial to the sacrifices of Russian soldiers in liberating the Auschwitz concentration camp.


Netanyahu claimed that he was able to persuade Putin to delay the sale of advanced weapons, including S-300 missiles to Syria. Israeli warplanes struck Iranian military targets inside Syria on May 10, the very next day, suggesting that Netanyahu may have given Putin advance notice of the attack. The Russian reaction to the incident was muted, while highlighting Russian mediation. “In our contacts with Iranian and Israeli leaders, including at the May 9 meeting between President of Russia Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, we have repeatedly noted the need for both sides to avoid any actions that would provoke the other,” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “Iran and Israel assure us that they have no such intentions, but, as you know, incidents, nevertheless, happen. It is particularly alarming that they occur despite the fact that all of us have underscored our commitment to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria.”


Also on May 10, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov met with Iran's deputy foreign minister for political affairs, Abbas Araghchi, in Tehran. Putin himself worked the phones, speaking with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.


Maxim Suchkov explains that “Netanyahu understands he can’t sway Russia from its position opposing the US exit from the nuclear Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Therefore, while with Trump, Netanyahu sought to arm the US president with arguments for leaving the JCPOA, but with Putin, Netanyahu seeks to expose the ‘malignant nature of the Iranian regime’ and thus legitimize Israeli efforts at countering it. The latter is a hard sell with the Kremlin, but Netanyahu hopes that there is a chance that if Russia has heard the essence of Israeli concerns, Putin would be (a) more persuasive with Iran on its actions in Syria and (b) have a higher tolerance level for Israeli’s actions in Syria, and perhaps against Hezbollah in Lebanon.”


Suchkov reports that there is a deconfliction "hotline" between the Russian Khmeimim air base in Syria and the Israeli Kirya command center in Tel Aviv, and concludes that “while the parties still seek to lure Moscow to their own camp, they are also discovering that Russia’s role as the only ‘go-to’ entity for bilateral ‘matters of life and death’ might just be beneficial for them all. Therefore, whereas Putin may have genuine empathy for Netanyahu’s concerns and sincerely appreciate his symbolic overtures, he’d still be interested in listening to the opposite camp and measuring the recent moods in Damascus and Tehran. In this regard, one shouldn’t be surprised to see a high-level visitor or two from Syria or Iran to Russia rather soon.”


Turkish president tells Rouhani US decision on JCPOA is "wrong"


Erdogan said the United States will be the loser from the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the JCPOA while telling his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, that the US decision is “wrong.” Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said, “We do not wish the Iranian people to be negatively affected by these sanctions and we won’t hesitate to do our part if we’re to do something about them.”


Amberin Zaman writes that the “the timing of the US withdrawal [from the JCPOA] will have shifted Turkish conspiracy thinking into even higher gear.”


Zaman explains, “Iran is among Turkey’s top suppliers of oil and natural gas and a vital land bridge for Turkish truckers carrying goods to Central Asia. They are unable to access the region via neighboring Armenia, a far shorter route, because of Ankara’s refusal to open its borders with the former Soviet republic out of solidarity with Armenia’s top enemy Azerbaijan. The longtime regional rivals share a porous mountainous border and a common fear of Kurdish separatists active on both sides. The fear of Kurdish gains overseen by US forces in northern Syria has propelled Iran and Turkey into shelving their differences over the Syrian regime and their respective claims of leading Shiite and Sunni Muslims and forming an alliance with Russia.”


Adding to Turkish conspiratorial thinking is that “the decision comes as a federal court in Manhattan prepares to sentence Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Turkish banker accused of involvement in a Byzantine scheme that saw Turkey’s state-owned Halkbank allegedly conspiring with now jailed Iranian-Turkish gold trader Reza Zarrab to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through the US financial system on behalf of Iran. Erdogan and assorted Turkish officials have long charged that the case is part of a global plot to undermine Turkey. Meanwhile, Turkish businessmen nervously await the scale of an expected fine to be levied on Halkbank by the US Treasury and its likely effects on Turkey’s wobbly finances.”


Erdogan’s bravado may obscure alarm over the potential impact on Turkey of the renewal of US secondary sanctions on Iran. Fehim Tastekin reports, “Although some analysts think the new sanctions will not affect trading with Iran, some are predicting much tougher days ahead. Turkey — which had taken advantage of some tolerance by the United States earlier — is this time under strict surveillance, accused of breaking the original sanctions via Turkey’s state-owned Halkbank.”


Tastekin adds, “Turkish-American political relations have become much more complex. The United States' patience might be short now that Turkey has agreed to buy S-400 missile defense systems from Russia despite NATO’s reservations. The US Congress is also unhappy with Ankara because of Turkey's continuing detention of American missionary Andrew Brunson. Even if Trump includes exemptions for Turkey from the secondary sanctions, that may not win the approval of Congress.” 


Tastekin continues, “A group in the AKP wants Ankara to revert to the US-Israel axis because of economic threats Turkey is facing, while another group demands ‘resistance’ to the United States. But the prevailing opinion is that this time, the Turkish government may not support Iran.” 


Some of this may have to do with the value of their banknotes. “Now both sides must be ready for disappointment regarding their hope of using local currencies in their trade, as both Turkey's lira and Iran's rial weaken against the dollar, and the business world will not find it wise to use them in their transactions,” Tastekin concludes. “Turkey now faces a tough period. Which way its relations go with Iran will depend on the new list of US exemptions and whether Ankara can maintain its supportive attitude toward Tehran.”
Former Obama aide ‘speechless’ at Trump reversal on ZTE
A former aide under the Obama administration said he was surprised on Sunday by President TrumpDonald John TrumpUS paid Trump's Scottish resort for VIP hotel stays: report Michael Avenatti tweets, then deletes, Fox News booker's phone number Former Trump aide working with Russian company to lift US sanctions: report MORE’s announcement that he is working with China to help Chinese telecommunications equipment-maker ZTE get “back into business,” according to the Financial Times.
“I am speechless,” said Kevin Wolf, who was assistant secretary of commerce under President Obama.
Telecom giant ZTE is the fourth-largest phone vendor in the U.S. But, last month, the company was slapped with an export ban from the Commerce Department after the U.S. said it had violated a deal by circumventing sanctions against Iran and North Korea.
Wolf, who oversaw the beginning of the ZTE case during his time in the Obama administration told the Financial Times, “I’m highly confident that a [U.S.] president has never intervened in a law-enforcement matter like this before … It’s so outside the way the rules were set up.”  
Trump said on Sunday morning via Twitter that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to help boost ZTE. He added that too many jobs in China were lost because of ZTE’s issues and said he has instructed the Commerce Department to “get it done.”
President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 13, 2018Trump’s support for ZTE marks a departure from previous actions the White House and the federal government have taken against the company. Trump's comments also represent the second time in the past month that his administration has rolled back sanctions against a foreign company.
ZTE and competitor Huawei have routinely been scrutinized by regulators concerned that their products could pose a national security threat. 
The Justice Department has largely focused on sanctions violations while Congress has previously taken action against Chinese companies under the pretext of national security.
In Congress, lawmakers have pushed U.S. firms to distance themselves from Chinese companies, leading efforts to enact legislation barring the U.S. government from using products of companies such as Huawei, ZTE and others.
ZTE has reportedly been crippled by the ban because of its reliance on U.S. companies that provide critical supplies for its products. The company has submitted a formal request for the Commerce Department to stay the order that keeps American companies from selling it supplies.
Congresswoman Kristi Noem’s Weekly Column: No Matter the Call
No Matter the Call

By Rep. Kristi Noem

I am incredibly grateful for the work of South Dakota’s law enforcement officers. The job has never been easy, but with violent crime on the rise, a growing drug epidemic, and a looming mental health crisis, more is being asked of our men and women in blue than ever before.

Between 2005 and 2015, South Dakota’s violent crime rate doubled. Drug arrests are up. Aggravated assault and domestic violence is increasing. Sioux Falls has become more dangerous than Fargo, North Dakota, or Omaha, Nebraska. And people are feeling the impact. I hear all the time how our communities just don’t feel like they did 15 years ago; they feel less safe.

When President Trump was sworn in last year, he brought his profound respect for law enforcement into the Oval Office. Together, we’ve increased support for those in blue. For instance, we expanded Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grants, which are used for hiring and training police officers and have provided $13 million in funding to South Dakota law enforcement in the last five years.

In South Dakota, much of the drain on our resources comes from a growing drug epidemic. In recent months, Governor Daugaard declared that meth use in South Dakota was at epidemic levels. Opioid abuse is on the rise as well. While I believe prevention is key, I introduced a set of bills to strengthen families during drug addiction treatment and amplify efforts to prevent the child abuse and neglect that can result from drug use.

Additionally, I’m working to cut off drugs at their source. President Trump’s border wall is critical to stemming illegal drug trafficking, and I’ve voted to fully fund his proposal. I’m also working on legislation to crack down on Mexican drug traffickers and those who help facilitate their illicit activities at the border.

Moreover, we need to fix the quirks in the law that make law enforcement jobs harder, which is what my CUFF Act intends to do. The bill is commonsense: it prohibits individuals with outstanding felony warrants or parole violations from receiving certain Social Security benefits. It’s not only unfair to ask taxpayers to pay people who are fleeing the law, but it’s self-defeating to subsidize someone’s attempt to shirk law enforcement. As Staci Ackerman, Executive Director of the South Dakota Sheriffs’ Association said, the bill would “limit [a wanted felon or parole violator’s] ability to avoid justice using taxpayer dollars to evade capture.” This bill was passed in the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate.

Each of these tools aim to help law enforcement do their job better and more safely. This, in turn, keeps our communities safer. As we mark National Police Week on May 13 through 19, I ask that you find a way to thank the heroes who protect us every day as well as their families, who often wait anxiously for their loved one to return home each shift, not knowing what situations they faced that day.

Finally, on behalf of my family and I, please know that we’re praying for you and for your safety. I admire the work of our law enforcement officers and the courage required to respond no matter the call.

Mahathir’s return in Malaysia promises significant change in ties with U.S., China
Special to WorldTribune.com

By GIS/Defense  Foreign Affairs, Kuala Lumpur.

The return to office as Prime Minister of Malaysia of Dr Mahathir Mohamed, 92, on May 10, 2018, was expected to change the tone of affairs both within Malaysia as well as within the region.

Dr Mahathir Mohamad speaks at a press conference after being sworn in as Malaysia’s seventh Prime Minister on May 10, 2018.
Significantly, it is not Dr Mahathir’s age which was at the core of the changes which were anticipated, although he has indicated that he would hand over the office to his former Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, within “a few years”, and, in the meantime, would ensure a Royal Pardon for Anwar, who was, at the time of the election, still imprisoned on what were seen to be politically-motivated charges.

Malaysians had gone to the polls for the country’s 14th general election on May 9, 2018, to elect all 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat (People’s Hall) and 505 seats in 12 of the 13 state legislative assemblies.

What was particularly significant in this election was that former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 92, had re-emerged from retirement to contest the election on behalf of the opposition alliance, the Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope), in an attempt to remove his old party, Barisan Nasional (National Front), which dominated the governing UMNO coalition, and its Prime Minister, Najib Razak.

Dr Mahathir cited his anger over the corruption of Prime Minister Najib as his reason to return to politics and on the side of the opposition. UMNO had held 133 seats in the outgoing 13th Parliament, and Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia: PPBM), which was included in the Pakatan Harapan alliance, had 68 seats. What was perhaps more significant was that Pakatan Harapan had been led by Anwar Ibrahim, onetime deputy to then Prime Minister Mahathir, who had been consistently attacked by the UMNO Government, and was still in prison after facing allegations of sodomy.

Dr Mahathir had said that he would hand over the Prime Ministership to Dr Anwar when he was released from prison. Late on election night, even as rioting occurred when it was alleged that Government officials were attempting to introduce fake stuffed ballot boxes into the count, it became clear that Dr Mahathir — he had abandoned BN in 2016 — had secured more than the 112 seats needed for a majority. His coalition was confirmed to have taken 115 seats, and UMNO took 79 seats (a third party, Gagasan Sejahtera [Ideas of Prosperity, an Islamist party], part of the Malaysian Islamic Party, PAS, took 17 seats). UMNO’s loss marked the first change of power in Malaysia since independence in 1963.

Datuk Seri Wan Azizah binti Wan Ismail, who had been leading the opposition — and the presidency of the People’s Justice Party, part of Pakatan Harapan, and husband to Anwar Ibrahim — was named Deputy Prime Minister.

The strategic impact of the change of government included the fact that Dr Mahathir promised to scale back the level of former Prime Minister Najib Razak’s commitment to closeness with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). This would create minor concerns for Beijing, which had been working with the Najib Government on a range of logistical links bringing the Malay Peninsula into dependency on the PRC’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), such as a proposed new rail link.

This may be a subtle change, but it would open new prospects for better strategic relations between Malaysia and the United States (and its “Quadripartite” partners, Australia, Japan, and possibly India) at a time when the U.S. was, in particular, attempting to claw back influence in the region.

Trump said on Sunday morning via Twitter that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to help boost ZTE. He added that too many jobs in China were lost because of ZTE’s issues and said he has instructed the Commerce Department to “get it done.”
President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 13, 2018Trump’s support for ZTE marks a departure from previous actions the White House and the federal government have taken against the company. Trump's comments also represent the second time in the past month that his administration has rolled back sanctions against a foreign company.
ZTE and competitor Huawei have routinely been scrutinized by regulators concerned that their products could pose a national security threat. 
The Justice Department has largely focused on sanctions violations while Congress has previously taken action against Chinese companies under the pretext of national security.
In Congress, lawmakers have pushed U.S. firms to distance themselves from Chinese companies, leading efforts to enact legislation barring the U.S. government from using products of companies such as Huawei, ZTE and others.
ZTE has reportedly been crippled by the ban because of its reliance on U.S. companies that provide critical supplies for its products. The company has submitted a formal request for the Commerce Department to stay the order that keeps American companies from selling it supplies.
Congresswoman Kristi Noem’s Weekly Column: No Matter the Call
No Matter the Call

By Rep. Kristi Noem

I am incredibly grateful for the work of South Dakota’s law enforcement officers. The job has never been easy, but with violent crime on the rise, a growing drug epidemic, and a looming mental health crisis, more is being asked of our men and women in blue than ever before.

Between 2005 and 2015, South Dakota’s violent crime rate doubled. Drug arrests are up. Aggravated assault and domestic violence is increasing. Sioux Falls has become more dangerous than Fargo, North Dakota, or Omaha, Nebraska. And people are feeling the impact. I hear all the time how our communities just don’t feel like they did 15 years ago; they feel less safe.

When President Trump was sworn in last year, he brought his profound respect for law enforcement into the Oval Office. Together, we’ve increased support for those in blue. For instance, we expanded Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grants, which are used for hiring and training police officers and have provided $13 million in funding to South Dakota law enforcement in the last five years.

In South Dakota, much of the drain on our resources comes from a growing drug epidemic. In recent months, Governor Daugaard declared that meth use in South Dakota was at epidemic levels. Opioid abuse is on the rise as well. While I believe prevention is key, I introduced a set of bills to strengthen families during drug addiction treatment and amplify efforts to prevent the child abuse and neglect that can result from drug use.

Additionally, I’m working to cut off drugs at their source. President Trump’s border wall is critical to stemming illegal drug trafficking, and I’ve voted to fully fund his proposal. I’m also working on legislation to crack down on Mexican drug traffickers and those who help facilitate their illicit activities at the border.

Moreover, we need to fix the quirks in the law that make law enforcement jobs harder, which is what my CUFF Act intends to do. The bill is commonsense: it prohibits individuals with outstanding felony warrants or parole violations from receiving certain Social Security benefits. It’s not only unfair to ask taxpayers to pay people who are fleeing the law, but it’s self-defeating to subsidize someone’s attempt to shirk law enforcement. As Staci Ackerman, Executive Director of the South Dakota Sheriffs’ Association said, the bill would “limit [a wanted felon or parole violator’s] ability to avoid justice using taxpayer dollars to evade capture.” This bill was passed in the House and is awaiting a vote in the Senate.

Each of these tools aim to help law enforcement do their job better and more safely. This, in turn, keeps our communities safer. As we mark National Police Week on May 13 through 19, I ask that you find a way to thank the heroes who protect us every day as well as their families, who often wait anxiously for their loved one to return home each shift, not knowing what situations they faced that day.

Finally, on behalf of my family and I, please know that we’re praying for you and for your safety. I admire the work of our law enforcement officers and the courage required to respond no matter the call.

Mahathir’s return in Malaysia promises significant change in ties with U.S., China
Special to WorldTribune.com

By GIS/Defense  Foreign Affairs, Kuala Lumpur.

The return to office as Prime Minister of Malaysia of Dr Mahathir Mohamed, 92, on May 10, 2018, was expected to change the tone of affairs both within Malaysia as well as within the region.

Dr Mahathir Mohamad speaks at a press conference after being sworn in as Malaysia’s seventh Prime Minister on May 10, 2018.
Significantly, it is not Dr Mahathir’s age which was at the core of the changes which were anticipated, although he has indicated that he would hand over the office to his former Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, within “a few years”, and, in the meantime, would ensure a Royal Pardon for Anwar, who was, at the time of the election, still imprisoned on what were seen to be politically-motivated charges.

Malaysians had gone to the polls for the country’s 14th general election on May 9, 2018, to elect all 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat (People’s Hall) and 505 seats in 12 of the 13 state legislative assemblies.

What was particularly significant in this election was that former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 92, had re-emerged from retirement to contest the election on behalf of the opposition alliance, the Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope), in an attempt to remove his old party, Barisan Nasional (National Front), which dominated the governing UMNO coalition, and its Prime Minister, Najib Razak.

Dr Mahathir cited his anger over the corruption of Prime Minister Najib as his reason to return to politics and on the side of the opposition. UMNO had held 133 seats in the outgoing 13th Parliament, and Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia: PPBM), which was included in the Pakatan Harapan alliance, had 68 seats. What was perhaps more significant was that Pakatan Harapan had been led by Anwar Ibrahim, onetime deputy to then Prime Minister Mahathir, who had been consistently attacked by the UMNO Government, and was still in prison after facing allegations of sodomy.

Dr Mahathir had said that he would hand over the Prime Ministership to Dr Anwar when he was released from prison. Late on election night, even as rioting occurred when it was alleged that Government officials were attempting to introduce fake stuffed ballot boxes into the count, it became clear that Dr Mahathir — he had abandoned BN in 2016 — had secured more than the 112 seats needed for a majority. His coalition was confirmed to have taken 115 seats, and UMNO took 79 seats (a third party, Gagasan Sejahtera [Ideas of Prosperity, an Islamist party], part of the Malaysian Islamic Party, PAS, took 17 seats). UMNO’s loss marked the first change of power in Malaysia since independence in 1963.

Datuk Seri Wan Azizah binti Wan Ismail, who had been leading the opposition — and the presidency of the People’s Justice Party, part of Pakatan Harapan, and husband to Anwar Ibrahim — was named Deputy Prime Minister.

The strategic impact of the change of government included the fact that Dr Mahathir promised to scale back the level of former Prime Minister Najib Razak’s commitment to closeness with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). This would create minor concerns for Beijing, which had been working with the Najib Government on a range of logistical links bringing the Malay Peninsula into dependency on the PRC’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), such as a proposed new rail link.

This may be a subtle change, but it would open new prospects for better strategic relations between Malaysia and the United States (and its “Quadripartite” partners, Australia, Japan, and possibly India) at a time when the U.S. was, in particular, attempting to claw back influence in the region. [The U.S.-DPRK summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and DPRK leader Kim Jong-Un in Singapore on June 12, 2018, was another step by the U.S. to regain influence in the region.]

But, domestically, Prime Minister Mahathir was compelled, and willing, to deliver on his campaign promise to reduce corruption in the Malaysian Government. His credibility in this would depend on how vigorously he prosecuted officials engaged in the 1MDB (1Malaysia Development Berhad) case, the event which may have precipitated the fall of Prime Minister Najib’s UMNO/Barisan Nasional Government. Mr. Najib was accused of diverting more than RM2.67-billion (appr. $700-million) from 1MDB, a government-run strategic development company, to his personal bank accounts.

Once that scandal was investigated, there would be nothing to stop the unraveling of then-Prime Minister Najib’s allegedly illegal dealings with the French Parti Socialiste in the procurement of the Royal Malaysian Navy’s “white elephant” program to acquire two Scorpène and one Agosta 70 submarines. [This was covered by this service on April 13, 2012, as “Defense Procurement: Politicization Without Performance; How the Malaysian Submarine Scandal Could Help Determine the Outcomes of the French and Malaysian Elections”] This scandal reportedly was highly financially beneficial to both Prime Minister Najib and (now) former French President François Hollande (before he took office).

On April 3, 2013, this report detailed how the RMN would, after all the costs, now dispose of the two Scorpènes, quoting Prime Minister Najib as saying “The damn things have never caused us anything but trouble. If we hadn’t bought them, we could have held that stinking election a year ago and I’d be home and dry by now.”

So Dr Mahathir would now push the Government to prosecute outgoing Prime Minister Najib and members of his Government. Indeed, Dr Mahathir was stirred to return to government when he saw the degree to which his former party and bloc, Barisan Nasional and the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), had descended into such blatant corruption. The question will be how much of this scandal would lead to officials in France and the PRC.
