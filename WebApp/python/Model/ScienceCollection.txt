			    Mother’s Day First Warning Forecast: Big temperature spread, late-day t-shower possible
			  

			  
			

		


		High pressure will continue to be in control this evening with mostly clear skies. It will be a warm night with lows in the upper 60s to near 70. Keeping a very slight chance for a shower or storm after midnight. We have a frontal boundary that will be sagging to our south, so something could pop up.

 

Mother’s Day will be partly cloudy. We will have quite the temperature spread because of that stalled front. We could see highs anywhere from the 70s to near 90 again. Looks like the northern communities and near the coast will be the cooler ones. Shower and storm chances will remain low, but with our stalled front we do still have a chance especially late in the day. Just keeping a 25-30 percent chance.

 

Monday will be very similar temperature-wise. Expect a big temperature spread, with the coolest temperature in the 70s on the Eastern Shore and warmer temperatures for northeast North Carolina. We could see an afternoon shower or storm. Keeping the forecast very similar to Sunday with just a 25-30 percent chance.

 

We will be entering a very summer-like pattern, with rain chances pretty much everyday next week. Keep that umbrella handy! The best chances will come midweek when an area of low pressure moves in. Temperatures will trend mainly in the upper 70s to mid 80s over the next week.

A new fissure from the Hawaii volcano is spattering lava — and it's just east of a geothermal energy plant
A new lava fissure has opened up on Hawaii's Big Island in the vicinity of a geothermal energy plant.
Just hours after the fissure opened up on Saturday morning, red and black lava had piled up about 40 feet high and more than 150 feet in length, while magma chunks sprayed up to 100 feet in the air, Reuters reported.
Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has been continuously erupting for years, but an uptick in eruptions and earthquakes in recent days have ramped up the danger for residents of Hawaii's Big Island.
Thousands of people have now been forced to evacuate, and the eruption has already destroyed dozens of structures. Geologists are warning that the volcano's summit crater could soon begin spewing huge boulders and ash.
Here's what the new fissure looks like:
Hereâ€™s your Motherâ€™s Day forecast
CLEVELAND - It has been a challenging forecast this weekend because of the stalled front teetering back and forth across Northeast Ohio!Â  The severe storm threat is over for now with a cool evening on tap.Â  Showers could move into our western areas through midnight.

Flash flooding possible overnight in Chicago area
CHICAGO (Sun-Times Media Wire) - Low clouds moved in on Chicago Saturday afternoon covering much of the cityâ€™s skyline, while incoming storms were expected to bring heavy downpours and flash flooding across the city after dark, according to the National Weather Service Chicago.
Multiple rounds of thunderstorms tonight were expected to drop one to two inches of rain on the Chicagoland area, causing floods with fast moving water thatÂ could knock pedestrians off their feet andÂ sweep vehicles away or leave them stuck on impassable roads, the weather service said.
The weather service issued a Flash Flood Watch Saturday afternoon for Chicago and portions of northeast Illinois and northwest Indiana. Residents of the affected areas were advised to sign up for flood alerts, know which roads were likely to flood and seek out alternate routes.
The watch will remain in effect until Sunday morning.Â Â 
Rain early Saturday brought clouds as low as 400 feet to the downtown area. The cloudy coverage cleared by the early evening to reveal the top and bottom of the skyline, but more rain overnightÂ is expected to bring dark, low clouds back for most of Sunday, the weather service said.
Temperatures were expected to be in the low to mid 50s Sunday, with rain through the early morning.

Jurassic Fossil Tail Could Be Missing Link In Crocodile Family Tree
 Paleontologists have discovered a Jurassic fossil tail, which could be the missing link in the family tree of crocodiles. During the Jurassic periodÂ between 200 to 145 million years ago, ancient crocodiles had two basic forms. One group had dino-like armor and used limbs for walking on land. The other group was more dolphin-like, having tail fins and flippers and no armors. Researchers said that the 180 million-year-old fossil belonged to an intermediary species that featured both armor and tail fins. "This fossil provides a unique insight into how crocodiles began evolving into dolphin and killer whale-like forms more than 180 million years ago," saidÂ Mark Young, from the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences. The researcher said that the presence of both the tail fin and bony armor shows the remarkable diversity of crocodiles during the Jurassic period. Young and colleagues, who dug up the tail in a mountain in Hungary in 1996, called the new species Magyarosuchus fitosi after Attila Fitos. Scientists distinguished the fossil to be different from other species because of an odd-looking vertebra that formed part of the creature's tail fin. In a study published in the journal PeerJ, Young and colleagues described the species that featured pointed teeth that were likely used for grasping prey and a body measuring 5 meters long. "The unique combination of retaining heavy dorsal and ventral armor, while having a slight hypocercal tail, on the other hand, highlights the mosaic manner of marine adaptations in Metriorhynchoidea," the researchers wroteÂ in their study. Crocodiles are unique creatures in that they barely changed over the course of millions of years. Unlike most animals that live today, these prehistoric-looking creatures remained virtually untouched by major evolutionary changes for at least 8 million years. "If we could step back in time 8 million years, you'd basically see the same animal crawling around then as you would see today in the Southeast. Even 30 million years ago, they didn't look much different," saidÂ Evan Whiting, a doctoral student at the University of Minnesota, who studies crocodiles. Studying crocodilesÂ provide researchers opportunity to study other animals such as to learn how birds may have evolved from dinosaurs and to identify possible characteristics of the now extinct dinosaurs. Researchers also study alligators and crocodiles to find more effective antibiotic treatments due to these creatures' robust immune system.

LISA Observatory Might Be Able To Detect 'Dozens' Of Milky Way Binaries
 Although LISA isn't expected to launch until 2034, scientists are excited about the observatory's potential discoveries, including the aforementioned binary systems. It wonâ€™t be another 15 years or so before the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observatory is launched into outer space, but astronomers are already excited about the potential discoveries its launch could yield. A new study, in fact, suggests that LISA might be able to detect â€œdozensâ€ of binaries, or pairs of gravitationally bound, orbiting compact objects, in Milky Wayâ€™s globular clusters. A news release published in EurekAlert described the study published Friday by a team of Northwestern University researchers, which suggests that our galaxy might be teeming with binaries, and that LISA would be able to spot these pairings of objects. The binaries might include a variety of pairings, including combinations that include black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarf stars alongside more conventional counterparts. Interestingly, the researchers also predicted that LISA could find binaries that have their own peculiarities that set them apart from those that formed in isolation. As further noted in the EurekAlert news release, the Northwestern study, which was published in the journal Physical Review Letters, is the first of its kind to predict LISA binary sources with globular cluster models. LISA is expected to launch in 2034, with capabilities that allow it to detect lower frequency gravitational waves than those spotted by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), an Earth-bound observatory best known for being the first to detect gravitational waves from distant black hole collisions. â€œLISA is sensitive to Milky Way systems and will expand the breadth of the gravitational wave spectrum, allowing us to explore different types of objects that arenâ€™t observable with LIGO,â€ said study first author Kyle Kremer, a physics and astronomy doctoral student at Northwestern Universityâ€™s Weinberg Colleges of Arts and Sciences. LISA could detect dozens of binary black holes in globular clusters across the Milky Way â€“ https://t.co/hEjiNHcSPJ pic.twitter.com/lFh5WCl3XZ â€” Fraser Cain (@fcain) May 12, 2018  The methodologies used by Kremer and his colleagues included the analysis of over 100 â€œfully evolvedâ€ globular cluster models similar to the 150 or so that have been confirmed so far to exist in our galaxy. These models were created at Northwesternâ€™s Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA), and were tested on the universityâ€™s Quest cluster of supercomputers, which only take a few days to predict the entire 12-billion-year lifespan of the average globular cluster. â€œThis study is helping us understand what science is going to be contained in the LISA data,â€ said CIERA associate director and study co-author Shane Larson. All in all, the researchers believe that LISA will be able to detect binaries in about a third of the Milky Wayâ€™s known globular clusters. Furthermore, the study suggests that LISA will be able to detect about eight black hole binaries in Milky Wayâ€™s neighboring galaxy Andromeda, and about 10 times as many in Virgo, another nearby galaxy.

'Exiled' Ancient Asteroid Spotted In The Kuiper Belt Reveals Our Solar System's 'Troubled Youth'
 This relic of the primordial solar system is the first carbon-rich asteroid ever detected so far out from the Sun. Astronomers have long theorized that during the early chaotic days of our solar system the newly formed planets kicked out small rocky bodies from the inner regions of the system towards the outer reaches of the Kuiper Belt. By their estimations, this icy region that lies beyond Neptune should be populated with a small number of carbon-rich asteroids (C-type or carbonaceous asteroids), ejected by the young gas giants and flung billions of miles from where they originated. So far, researchers have had to rely solely on theoretical models of the early solar system in order to understand its â€œtempestuousâ€ beginnings, notes the European Southern Observatory (ESO). But a newly discovered relic of those primordial times finally confirms their speculations, bearing testimony to â€œour solar systemâ€™s troubled youth,â€ shows an ESO news release. Using the observatoryâ€™s Very Large Telescope in Chile, a team of astronomers spotted an ancient asteroid in the Kuiper Belt that shouldnâ€™t have been there. The space rock, dubbed 2004 EW95, was signaled as an â€œanomalousâ€ Kuiper Belt Object by its unusual reflectance spectrum, or the pattern of light that it reflects. â€œThe reflectance spectrum of 2004 EW95 was clearly distinct from the other observed outer solar system objects,â€ said team leader Tom Seccull, from the Queenâ€™s University Belfast in the U.K. â€œIt looked enough of a weirdo for us to take a closer look,â€ he explained. #Exiled #Asteroid discovered in #Outer Reaches of #Solar System ESO telescopes find first confirmed #carbon-rich asteroid in #Kuiper Belt. This curious object likely formed in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and has been flung billions of kms. https://t.co/aDn1jVT5hd pic.twitter.com/4BwlXVayuG â€” Tali (@talius) May 12, 2018  With the help of the VLTâ€™s X-Shooter and FORS2 instruments, Seccullâ€™s team managed to measure the composition of the 300-kilometer-wide (or 186-mile-wide) asteroid and uncovered that 2004 EW95 is carbon-rich. This makes it the first carbonaceous asteroid to ever be detected so far out from the sun. The astronomers suspect that 2004 EW95 was formed in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and that it got hurled all the way out to the cold reaches of the Kuiper Belt during an early planetary shuffle. Their theory is based on the ferric oxides and phyllosilicates uncovered by the VLT in the asteroidâ€™s reflectance spectrum. These materials had never been identified in a Kuiper Belt Object before and indicate that 2004 EW95 originated in the inner solar system and was exiled to its present home. This spectacular discovery is detailed in a paper, published last month in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. But studying this unique and strange relic of the early solar system proved to be a daunting task. The asteroid is situated very far from Earth, at a staggering distance of four billion kilometers (or about 2.4 billion miles), which makes it difficult to investigate. Furthermore, 2004 EW95 is not just â€œvery faintâ€ but also constantly moving, notes study co-author Thomas Puzia, from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. In addition, the carbon molecules in its composition make it look very dark on the surface. â€œItâ€™s like observing a giant mountain of coal against the pitch-black canvas of the night sky,â€ Puzia pointed out. Olivier Hainaut, an ESO astronomer who wasnâ€™t involved in the study, chimed in on the teamâ€™s discovery. â€œWhile there have been previous reports of other â€˜atypicalâ€™ Kuiper Belt Object spectra, none were confirmed to this level of quality.â€ According to Hainaut, finding a carbonaceous asteroid in the Kuiper Belt confirms the predictions of the theoretical models and shows that astronomers were right about the turbulent early days of the solar system.

Scientists know when Sun will die; What will happen to life on Earth?
 A group of international scientists used a hi-tech computer model to clarify that what will happen to the universe in future. The results stunned them all, as the research stated that within 5-billion-years the Sun will burn out and it will become a vast ring of interstellar gas with dust and that will release the light. A team that includes Professor Albert Zijlstra, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Manchester in England, knows that when the sun will die and what will happen after that. The recent findings are being published in journal Nature Astronomy. Zijlstra said that in the absence of the Sun, the image of a planetary nebula, which is a kind of emission nebula consisting of a glowing and expanding shell of ionized gas ejected from red giant stars late in their lives will be visible for millions of lights years from the nearest galaxies. "Planetary nebulae are among the prettiest objects in the night sky. It is nice to know that the sun will, one day, also make one, even if we won't be around to enjoy it!" he told NBC News MACH. Researchers call the Sun an ordinary star. They said that if the hydrogen core of the brightest star of this galaxy ends, then the Sun will also die. Due to the nuclear reaction outside, the sun will expand to the size of a red giant. In that case, it would engulf two big planets of this solar system, Mercury and Venus but the source of the earth's light will lose about half of the mass because the outer bark will swell at a speed of 20 kilometres per second. The size of the Sun will be almost 250 times bigger than its current expanse. The scientist added that the heated core of Sun will emit ultraviolet light and x-rays, as well as the outer layers, will catch and convert into a glowing ring of plasma. The planetary nebula will shine for about 10,000 to 20,000 years. Zijlstra added in a statement that as per the collected data "you could get bright planetary nebulae from low mass stars like the sun. The models said that was not possible, anything less than about twice the mass of the sun would give a planetary nebula too faint to see." An astronomy professor at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, Dr Karen Kwitter, told MACH that the understanding about the sun's future has "ping-ponged back and forth, now, these newest models say that yes, the sun will produce a planetary nebula." Zijlstra also told The Guardian that even though nebula of the sun would not be as bright as the ones produced by bigger stars, "If you lived in the Andromeda Galaxy two million light-years away, you'd still be able to see it." However, in terms of earth's survival after the death of the main energy source, Sun, the New Scientist reported that there is a slim chance for the blue planet to exist when the brightest star of the galaxy begins its death throes has been ruled out. So during the speculated process, the sun will lose its gravitational pull on earth and that will allow the planet to migrate to a wider orbit. But, Peter SchrÃ¶der of the University of Guanajuato in Mexico and Robert Smith of the University of Sussex, UK stated that earth cannot escape from the destruction. Even though planet earth survives after the death of Sun, the life on its surface will finish long before that. As per the scientists, within 2 billion years the temperature of the planet will be so high that all the oceans will start to boil.
Venus and Jupiter might be playing with Earth's orbit
  Our planet follows a remarkably circular trajectory around the Sun, but as new research indicates, the Earthâ€™s orbit sometimes undergoes a slight jolt, due to the combined gravitational influence of Jupiter and Venus. More surprising: this little gravitational game seems to last for at least 215 million years! According to a recent study by Dennis V. Kent, a professor at Rutgers University, gas giant Jupiter and our former â€œtwin sisterâ€ Venus are lengthening â€“ thanks to their gravitational force â€“ the orbit of the Earth to a tiny degree, but nevertheless measurable every 405,000 years. The researcher believes that this highly predictable and long-lasting celestial model could be used to study geological changes on Earth, as well as the resulting environmental and ecological changes. And because this cycle goes back to the late Triassic era, it could even tell us something about dinosaurs. Astronomers had suspected these gravitational influences for some years, but empirical evidence was lacking and global motion models dated back only 50 million years. To find evidence of this hypothetical cycle on Earth, researchers analyzed sediment samples taken from the United States in the Chinle Formation â€“ in the Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona â€“ and in the Newark Basin, bed of an old prehistoric lake. The samples taken from these sites were about 6 centimeters in diameter and about 500 meters in length. The deeper the researchers went, the more they went back in time to finally enter the Triassic Period, the first of three geological epochs in which dinosaurs lived. By analyzing the samples, the team listed long-term data on inversions of the magnetic poles of the Earth. These periodic â€“ but irregular â€“ reversals can be observed in sediments containing zircon minerals with uranium, which can be used for radiocarbon dating, allowing the sample to serve as a clock. Climate changes have been observed in sediments in the form of alternating periods of dry and wet weather. As noted in the study, the samples were correlated with a remarkably continuous cycle dating back some 215 million years to the Triassic period. â€œClimate cycles are directly related to how the Earth rotates around the Sun, and slight variations in sunlight reaching the Earth lead to climate and ecological changes,â€ the researcher said in a statement, noting in passing that Earthâ€™s orbit is growing by about 5% every 405,000 years. As noted in the study, Venus, the planet closest to Earth, and Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, seem to be affecting our orbital trajectory due to their combined severity, and this every 405,000 years. As a result, the researcher suggests that seasonal changes on Earth could then be more pronounced, producing warmer summers, colder winters, wetter rainy seasons and more arid droughts. Currently, our planet is in the middle of the cycle, with the last major orbital influence occurring about 200,000 years ago. Editor of The Talking Democrat.

Space station's orbit raised by 600 meters ahead of manned Soyuz missions
 
 MOSCOW, May 13. /TASS/. The Russian Mission Control Center on Sunday adjusted the orbit of the International Space Station (ISS) by 600 meters in the run-up to manned Soyuz missions, a mission control official told TASS. "The maneuver was conducted with the help of Progress MS-08 thrusters that remained switched on for 172 seconds," the source said. As a result, the average altitude of the ISS increased by 600 meters, to 404.7 kilometers, he added. The adjustment was necessary for creating proper ballistic conditions prior to the Soyuz MS-07 departure from ISS on June 3 and the launch of the Soyuz MS-09 to the station on June 6. It was also necessary for a 6.5-hour spacewalk by NASA astronauts Richard Arnold and Andrew Feustel, due on May 16. Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Oleg Artemyev, NASA astronauts Scott Tingle, Richard Arnold and Andrew Feustel, and also Japanese astronaut Norishige Kanai are currently working aboard the space station. Shkaplerov, Tingle and Kanai are planned to return to the Earth aboard the Soyuz MS-07 spacecraft on June 3. Also, the launch of the manned Soyuz-MS-09 spacecraft with the crew of the new expedition to the ISS is planned from the Baikonur spaceport for June 6. The new crew will comprise Russian cosmonaut Sergei Prokopyev, NASA astronaut Serena Aunon and European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst (Germany).
New Planet might found by CS Cha Researchers
 CS Cha Research Study Members Indicate Possibility of New Planet There is enjoyable news for the space-curious individuals! Astronomers have actually just recently found a brand new things, most likely a brand-new world, in the area. This alien world was spotted accompanied by 2 little stars. This wonderful discovery was made throughout the research study of CS Cha which is a million years of ages double star. The members associated with the research study stated that the recently found things has actually not yet been recognized for what it is. Inning Accordance With Christian Ginski, primary research study author, Leiden Observatory (Netherlands) the just recently discovered item is apparently confined by dust particles that come from the item just. This dust enclosure is obstructing the close-by light and for that reason, validating the size of this just recently discovered things stays insufficient, stated Ginski. For this reason, there are opportunities that it can end up being a brown dwarf star or a huge heavenly body, most likely a huge world, included Ginski. The scientists associated with the continuous CS Cha research study were continuously keeping a look for any possible disks of dust or brand-new worlds. They were performing this research study utilizing SPHERE (Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet Research Study) which lies on the European Southern Observatory. Throughout the improvement of the research study, the research study members got shocked and happy to find a brand-new. This brand-new area lay in the surrounding location of the CS Cha double star. The approximated range of this brand-new things has actually been figured out as almost 2 hundred and fourteen AU (Huge System) from the neighboring binary stars of the CS Cha system. As soon as the freshly discovered area lay, the research study members looked for aid from images offered through various scopes in the past. The employee took referral of appropriate images submitted in the earlier records and discovered a wonderful resemblance in those images. They saw that the freshly found item stood in the type of a dot in those images. Among such images was eleven years of ages and related to CS CHA system. Another photo with the area was nineteen years of ages, and it came from the Hubble Area Telescope of NASA. It has actually been concluded that the area has actually been accompanying the journey of CS Cha system for a long period of time and can be a world. While everybody wait on more updates on this discovery of a â€˜possible brand-new worldâ€™ the research study has actually been accepted by Journal of Astronomy & Astrophysics for publication.

    SpaceX launches the first Falcon 9 Block 5 from Kennedy Space Center on Friday, May 11, 2018.
    Florida Today A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from Kennedy Space Center on Friday, May 11, 2018 with a Bangladeshi communications satellite.(Photo: Craig Bailey, FLORIDA TODAY)Buy Photo The newest iteration of SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket took flight from Kennedy Space Center on Friday, carrying with it lessons learned from two years of reusability operations and the company's ambitions to send humans beyond Earth orbit. The 4:14 p.m. blastoff from pad 39A marked the premiere flight for the launch vehicle, known as Falcon 9 Block 5, and its ultimately successful mission to deliver Bangladesh's first geostationary satellite to orbit. Before liftoff, company CEO Elon Musk conferenced with reporters and explained the how the new rocket should enable SpaceX to implement reuse more efficiently, all while developing its next launch vehicle. Here's what we know: It might not seem like it, but the Falcon 9 family has been around for a while â€“Â June will mark eight years since the vehicle first flew in 2010. Block 5, which according to Musk is arguably the sixth version of the rocket, will be the last major overhaul. Its improvements are ultimately designed to allow for more reusability and reliability, allowing the company to launch more with less. "This will be the last major version of Falcon 9 before BFR," Musk said while referencing the Big Falcon Rocket, or BFR, which is under development and will be constructed at the Port of Los Angeles before transport to the Space Coast. "Expect this to be a mainstay of SpaceX's business." Musk expects that with little to no refurbishment between missions, Block 5 boosters should be able to launch 10 times; with moderate work, they could launch up to 100 times. During those first 10 launches, Musk said the only necessary operations should be quick inspections and propellant loading. Another key aspect of developing Block 5, Musk said, was making sure it meets NASA's human-rating standards for eventual crewed missions. That list includes thousands of items, but the rocket will have to fly several times before it can be approved for crewed flights to the International Space Station, which are expected late this year or early next year.

That's about 1.7 million pounds of thrust for the entire vehicle. New black components: The all-white Falcon 9 is gone in favor of a mix that includes black segments composed of flame and water-resistant felt, which doesn't require paint. These black segments include the interstage, which sits between the first and second stages, a "raceway" that runs the length of the booster, and the landing legs. Upgrades to landing legs: The four landing legs, meanwhile, get a major revision for Block 5 and many of the features that were once on the outside have been moved inside. The internal latching mechanism, for example, can now be opened and closed with ease. Before, it took teams several hours to re-stow the landing gear after a mission. Heat shield: A new heat shield at the base of the rocket means improved protections for a swath of components, as well as more flights before major refurbishment is necessary. The Octaweb and Merlin engines of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy side booster are seen at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in February 2018.Â (Photo: Emre Kelly / FLORIDA TODAY) Titanium grid fins now standard: The dark-colored titanium grid fins, which steer the booster during its descent back to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station or a drone ship for landing, are now standard across all Block 5 Falcon 9s. Previously, they were only flown on select missions, such as Falcon Heavy's debut flight in February. Musk said each fin is likely the largest single piece of forged titanium in the world. Fairing 2.0 now included: Each upgraded Falcon 9 will fly with a new, slightly larger fairing. The protective nose cones, which cost about $6 million, now include hardware that will allow SpaceX to one day recover them much like it does with boosters. Tests are underway on the West Coast to catch the fairing halves with a giant, ship-mounted net. Octaweb upgrades: The Octaweb, a metal structure that mounts eight engines surrounding the rocket's center engine, was previously welded. Now, the structure features bolted components so it can be more quickly and flexibly modified. Fuel loading: Propellant loading Block 5s is faster, too â€“Â instead of beginning at 70 minutes before launch like with previous Block 4 versions, teams begin loading liquid kerosene and liquid oxygen at T-minus 35 minutes. Musk for years has likened his company's efforts as chasing after that of the aircraft industry. Much like Boeing doesn't build a 747 for each flight, Musk has said, SpaceXÂ shouldn't have to build a brand new rocket for every mission. Reusing Block 5s 10 times or more should help SpaceX increase its margins on rockets, lower costs for customers and increase access to space â€“Â all things Musk needs to fund eventual trips to Mars with BFR, according to experts. "This rocket is really designed to be the most reliable rocket ever built," Musk said. "That is unequivocally the intent." A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from Kennedy Space Center on Friday, May 11, 2018 with a Bangladeshi communications satellite.Â (Photo: Craig Bailey, FLORIDA TODAY) SpaceX was widely believed to charge about $60 million per launch until Musk announced during the conference that prices will see a drop to about $50 million for a flight-proven booster. Customers opting to fly on brand new version of Falcon 9, meanwhile, will still see a $60 million price tag. He broke down the costs, too: The booster itself comes to about 60 percent of the cost; the second stage is 20 percent; the fairing accounts for 10 percent; and the launch itself fills the final 10 percent. Fueling, he said, only costs about $300,000 to $400,000 "depending on how you count it." SpaceX expects the Block 5 program as a whole to launch about 300 missions before the introduction of BFR into the manifest, but an increase in launch cadence is already underway: Teams are on track to double last year's total. "SpaceX will launch more rockets than any other country in 2018," Musk added. Musk also expects that a major milestone in spaceflight â€“Â something even touted by the Air Force as a significant accomplishment when it happens â€“Â should occur next year when SpaceX launches, lands and re-launches the same booster within 24 hours. "That will be truly remarkable to launch the same orbital-class rocket twice in one day," he said. Contact Emre Kelly at aekelly@floridatoday.com or 321-242-3715.

Thousands Of Black Holes Discovered In The Center Of Milky Way
 
				Posted: May 12 2018, 10:13am CDT | by Hira Bashir, Updated: May 12 2018, 10:58am CDT, in News | Latest Science News  Using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, researchers have discovered a massive swarm of black holes near the center of our galaxy Milky Way. The newly identified black holes are stellar-mass black holes which are formed by the gravitational collapse of extremely massive stars and typically weigh between five to 30 times the mass of the sun. These black holes are lying three light years away from Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black holes in the center of the galaxy. This is a relatively short distance in cosmic terms. Scientists have long assumed that Milky Way hosts a large population of stellar mass black holes in its center because of the halo of gas and dust around Sagittarius A*. This region of gas and dust could serve as a perfect breeding ground for the birth of massive stars, which live, die and could turn into black holes. Extensive searches have been made for these black holes over the years but no population has been detected until now. The recent analysis of Chandra data is the first observational evidence of such a treasure trove of black holes. Black holes themselves are invisible objects, so we cannot directly see them. However, a black hole or a neutron star locked in close orbit with another star constantly pulls the material away from its stellar companion, which falls onto a disk and produces momentary X-rays. The bright burst of X-ray glow that occurs in black hole binaries is sometimes captured by observatories like Chandra. When researchers used Chandra data to search for X-ray binaries containing black holes that are located near Sgr A*, they detected fourteen X-ray binaries within about three light years of the supermassive black hole. Based on the characteristic outbursts, researchers concluded that majority of these dozen X-ray binaries are likely to contain black holes instead of neutron stars. There must be anywhere from 300 to a thousand stellar-mass black holes in the area surrounding Sgr A*. The detection of such a large population of confirms a decades-old prediction and provides an opportunity to better understand the universe. â€œThe existence of a â€˜density cuspâ€™ â€“ a localized increase in number â€“ of stellar-mass black holes near a supermassive black hole is a fundamental prediction of galactic stellar dynamic. The best place to detect such a cusp is in the Galactic Centre, where the nearest supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, resides,â€ Authors wrote in the study.  â€œThe properties of these X-ray binaries, in particular, their spatial distribution and luminosity function, suggest the existence of hundreds of binary systems in the central parsec of the Galaxy and many more isolated black holes.â€

Authorities shocked by something happening at a Utah park
 May 12, 2018 by Dan Taylor Leave a Comment Visitors to Red Fleet State Park in Utah apparently cannot resist picking up large stones near a reservoir and then hurling them below to get a satisfying splash. The only problem is that the stones they are throwing are actually 200 million year old dinosaur tracks, and it has created a crisis of sorts for Utah park officials. Red Fleet State Park is known for its dinosaur footprints, but many tourists who visit are not aware of that. And unfortunately vandalism of those tracks are increasing, officials say, with visitors dislodging the tracks at an alarming rate in just the last six months. It has even prompted officials to consider hiring a dive team to retrieve some of the priceless rocks, although they realize that most of them will probably be destroyed anyway. Instead, officials are putting up signs warning tourists against throwing the rocks, which are often three to 17 inches in width. Authorities estimate that at least 10 of the larger more visible dinosaur footprints have been thrown into the reservoir. â€œThe dinosaur track site is deteriorating due to human impact,â€ the park wrote on their Facebook page recently. â€œThere has been a substantial impact to the track site from individuals throwing rocks (most containing dinosaur tracks) into the water over the past 6 months. People come to our park from all over the country and world to see this amazing feature. It is not illegal to throw rocks into the water, it is illegal to displace these rocks which contain tracks. Be aware disturbing these rocks is considered an act of vandalism. Many tracks are very distinguishable to the lay person but many are not. This is why it is so important to not disturb ANY rocks at the dinosaur track-way. You may not be able to tell if the rock you are tossing has millions of year old dinosaur tracks imprinted in it or not.â€ The full statement from Utah State Parks follows below. Here at Utah State Parks, we have a big problem and we need your help to fix it. Some visitors to Red Fleet State Park have been ripping up sandstone slabs containing 200-million-year-old dinosaur tracks and throwing them into the water. While this problem is quite alarming, often times the people who are doing this have no idea they could be destroying millions of years of history, Park Manager Josh Hansen said. â€œSome of the tracks are very distinct to the layperson,â€ Hansen said,â€but just as many are not. That is why it is important to not disturb any rocks at the dinosaur trackway.â€ People come to Red Fleet from across the country and the world to see wonders like these, Hansen said. By deteriorating the track site, people are taking away the experience from thousands of others. Not only that, but this act also constitutes a crime. â€œIt is illegal to displace rocks that contain the tracks,â€ Hansen said. â€œDisturbing them like this is an act of vandalism.â€ This problem has increased within the last six months; with a conservative estimate of at least 10 dinosaur tracks vandalized in that time. While there are existing signs in the area around the tracks, park staff have also started adding additional signs to help ensure people know to not disturb the site. Utah State Parks believes education can play a big part in stopping this kind of behavior. To help combat it, we are asking everyone to spread the word. Please, do not throw any rocks in the dinosaur track area at Red Fleet State Park. Help us keep the area preserved and beautiful for visitors both tomorrow and for generations to come. The following is an excerpt from a Wikipedia article about trace fossils. A trace fossil, also ichnofossil, is a geological record of biological activity. Trace fossils may consist of impressions made on the substrate by an organism: for example, burrows, borings (bioerosion), urolites (erosion caused by evacuation of liquid wastes), footprints and feeding marks, and root cavities. The term in its broadest sense also includes the remains of other organic material produced by an organism â€” for example coprolites (fossilized droppings) or chemical markers â€” or sedimentological structures produced by biological means â€“ for example, stromatolites. Trace fossils contrast with body fossils, which are the fossilized remains of parts of organismsâ€™ bodies, usually altered by later chemical activity or mineralization. Sedimentary structures, for example those produced by empty shells rolling along the sea floor, are not produced through the behaviour of an organism and not considered trace fossils. The study of traces â€“ ichnology â€“ divides into paleoichnology, or the study of trace fossils, and neoichnology, the study of modern traces. Ichnological science offers many challenges, as most traces reflect the behaviour â€” not the biological affinity â€” of their makers. Accordingly, researchers classify trace fossils into form genera, based on their appearance and on the implied behaviour, or ethology, of their makers.

Space Photos of the Week: Mini-Moons Make Saturn's Rings Extra Groovy
 This lovely abstract image of Saturnâ€™s rings is just one of the many unique photos captured by the Cassini spacecraft. The strong lines seem to intersect but they donâ€™t actuallyâ€”itâ€™s the angle of the spacecraft and the tilt of the planet that create the illusion. Notice the thick black line that stretches horizontally? That is called the Encke Gap; it is kept open by one of Saturnâ€™s tiniest and most famous moons, Pan. Take a very close look at the Encke Gap in the center of the image and there you will find Pan! The Sun looks blue in this image on account of an ultraviolet filter that shows features more clearly. What stands out here is the active region in the center of the photo. These bright arcs show highly charged particles escaping from the Sun along magnetic field lines. The Moon seems to float above Earth in this stunning image taken from the International Space Station on April 30. On our planet's surface, what you see is Newfoundland, Canada, but what you should really be looking at is the bright blue of the atmosphere. Itâ€™s easy to forget how thin our atmosphere isâ€”a delicate haze of clouds and water that separates us from the blackness of space. The Hubble Space Telescope strikes again with this space-time bending almost-image of a galaxy cluster, called SDSS J0150+2725. You might think itâ€™s the bright blue thing at the bottom, yet that is not the object at issue. Toward the top of the frame, light is being bent, distorting the shapes of galaxies that lie further off into the distance, and the culprit is the SDSS J0150+2725 galaxy cluster. While we canâ€™t see the cluster itself, we can see how it affects the space around it. Galaxy clusters like these are some of the most massive objects in the universe, and they contain so much mass that they influence the gravity around them, warping space-time. You are looking at a cluster of black holes. But we canâ€™t see black holes, you say! You are right, but what we can see is nearby light being sucked into black holes. This is Sagittarius A, the supermassive black hole at the center our Milky Way galaxy. Scientists at the Chandra X-ray observatory captured this black hole cluster in a clever way: Neutron stars emit gas, and if they are locked into orbit with a black hole, that black hole will steal gas from the star, creating a trail of light thatâ€™s essentially a fingerprint marking its existence. Welcome to space, Copernicus Sentinel-3B! This is the first image taken by the European Space Agency's new satellite, launched to study Earthâ€™s climate. Using its brand-new cameras, Sentinel-B captured sunset over Antarctica. The only daylight left is in the middle as the darkness of night creeps up from the bottom of the frame. Last week the Sun opened up again. Seen here filtered through an extreme UV light filter, which shows very high-energy radiation, the darker region is an opening in the star's magnetic field. These coronal holes spew highly charged particles called the solar wind. This sweeps out into space, eventually colliding with our own magnetic field, putting on a dazzling display of aurora for those near the north and south poles.

This week we are bounding around the universe, hovering above Earth in the International Space Station and then peeping at far-off black holes and space-warping galaxy clusters. Weâ€™ll also take a closer look at Saturnâ€™s rings. A mere 800 million miles away, Saturn boasts the most iconic planetary feature in our solar systemâ€”a wide belt of shiny rings. These rings are thought to be made up of comets and moons that have been ripped apart and destroyed and pulled inward by Saturnâ€™s gravity. Some of those particles are as small as grains of sand; some are as large as mountains. And theyâ€™re what makes Saturn, Saturn. Although Saturn is famous for its possibly habitable moons, Enceladus and Titan, it also has many tiny moons that orbit close to the rings. They even reside inside the rings, creating gaps that are like custom grooves on a planetary record. Two of the most well known mini-moons are Pan and Daphnis. Pan is called many things, including â€œravioli moon," because well, it looks like a giant space ravioli. And Daphnis not only has made its own channel, but also has created waves out of the icy particles nearby. Thatâ€™s because, while small, Daphnis still exerts enough gravitational force to influence Saturnâ€™s mighty rings. Not ready to return to the third stone from the Sun?

NJ Night Sky: The king of planets
 
    
        
            By Kevin D. Conod kconod@newarkmuseum.org  For The Star-Ledger Jupiter reached itsÂ oppositionÂ on Tuesday andÂ isÂ nowÂ in the sky all night. Although the planet is rising in the earlyÂ evening, its southerly position in the constellation Libra means that it takes a couple of hours for it to get high enough in the sky for good viewing. After 9:30 p.m. it should be visible above the treetops and rooftops. Around 12:30 a.m. Jupiter is at its highest point in the southern sky.Â Â  Good viewing conditions continue until 4 a.m. when the planet is in the southwest. Jupiter's distinctive parallelÂ bands of clouds are easily seen in small telescopes. Even at low magnifications you can often spotÂ three bands: a wide white one called the Equatorial Zone andÂ two prominent dark brownish ones, the North and South Equatorial Belts.Â With a larger telescope and clear skies, additional bands can be seen.Â These bands of clouds are actually moving in opposite directions with winds up to 200 miles per hour or more. The zones are likely gasses carrying ammonia risingÂ from the interior. The gasses rise and cool, forming dense clouds and ammonia ices which give the zones their white color. The belts are areas where gasses are sinking into the planet. The warmer temperatures here evaporateÂ the ammonia clouds and reveal the dark clouds that lie below.Â  Jupiter's Great Red Spot is famous but can be a challenge to see.Â This giant storm has been shrinking in size over the past few decades. The latest measurements from the Juno spacecraft show that it is less than half the size it used to be, now about 1.5 times as wide as the Earth. Its colorÂ can also change, fadingÂ from a dark red to a pale salmon colorÂ and back again. The red color of this storm and a smaller one nicknamed "Red Spot Jr." is a mystery, possiblyÂ due toÂ complex organic molecules, red phosphorus,Â orÂ aÂ sulfurÂ compoundÂ that is interacting with sunlight.Â Â  Keep in mind that JupiterÂ is rotating very fast: its day is only 9 hours 55 minutes long.Â This means that the Great Red Spot is not always facing us.Â If you want to see it, you need to look up when it is visible. Good times to look this week is on Tuesday atÂ 10:19 p.m. and Thursday atÂ 11:57 p.m. For additional times seeÂ Sky & Telescope'sÂ Great Red Spot calculator.Â  Jupiter has 69 moons in all. Many are small and difficult to spot in backyard telescopes but theÂ four largest moons of Jupiter areÂ veryÂ easy toÂ view.Â They are large enough and bright enough that they canÂ evenÂ be seen in binoculars. To identify the moons you can use Sky & Telescope'sÂ Jupiter moon calculatorÂ (though note this calculates the positions based on Universal Time (UT),Â which is 4 hours ahead of Eastern Time.Â For example,Â if you want to know what the moons will be like tonight atÂ 10Â p.m. you'll need to set the calculator forÂ 2Â a.m. tomorrow morning).Â There are also several smart phone apps available to calculate the positions of the Great Red Spot and the moons. Moon & VenusÂ  The moon is new on Tuesday and then returns to the evening sky later in the week. On Thursday night you can see the crescent moon near Venus. Look for them side by side in the west after 8:30 p.m. They should be visible until about 10:30 p.m.Â  Kevin D.

Can Artificial Intelligence Help Find Alien Intelligence?
 We use cookies to provide you with a better onsite experience. By continuing to browse the site you are agreeing to our use of cookies in accordance with our Cookie Policy. (examples: physics, climate change, etc.) Scientists are considering whether AI could help us search for alien intelligence in ways we havenâ€™t even thought of yet The following essay is reprinted with permission fromÂ The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research. In the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), weâ€™ve often looked for signs of intelligence, technology and communication that are similar to our own. But as astronomer and SETI trailblazer Jill TarterÂ points out, that approach means searching for detectableÂ technosignatures, like radio transmissions, not searching for intelligence. Now scientists are considering whether artificial intelligence (AI) could help us search for alien intelligence in ways we havenâ€™t even thought of yet. As we think about extraterrestrial intelligence itâ€™s helpful to rememberÂ humans are not the only intelligent lifeÂ on Earth. Chimpanzees have culture and use tools, spidersÂ process information with webs,Â cetaceans have dialects, crowsÂ understand analogiesÂ andÂ beavers are great engineers. Non-human intelligence, language, culture and technology are all around us. Alien intelligence could look like an octopus, an ant, a dolphin orÂ a machineÂ â€” or be radically different from anything on Earth. We often imagine extraterrestrial life relative to our ideas about difference, but those ideas arenâ€™t even universal on Earth and areÂ unlikely to be universal across interstellar space. If some of us have only recently recognized non-human intelligence on Earth, what could we be missing when we imagine extraterrestrial life? In early 2018, astronomers, neuroscientists, anthropologists, AI researchers, historians and others gathered for a â€œDecoding Alien Intelligenceâ€ workshop at the SETI Institute in Silicon Valley. Astrobiologist Nathalie Cabrol organized the workshop around her 2016 paper â€œAlien mindscapes,â€ where she calls for a new SETI road map and a long-term vision for â€œthe search for life as we do not know it.â€ In her paper, Cabrol asks how SETI can move past â€œlooking for other versions of ourselvesâ€ and think â€œoutside of our own brainsâ€ to imagine truly different extraterrestrial intelligence. Silicon Valley is famous for valuing â€œdisruptiveâ€ thinking and this culture intersects with SETI research. Ever since the U.S. governmentÂ stopped funding SETI in the mid-1990s, Silicon Valley ideas, technology and funding have been increasingly important. For example, the SETI Instituteâ€™sÂ Allen Telescope ArrayÂ is named after Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who contributed over US$25 million to the project. And, in 2015, technology investor Yuri Milner announcedÂ Breakthrough Listen, a 10-year US$100 million SETI initiative. Now, the SETI Institute, NASA, Intel, IBM and other partners are tackling space science problems through an AI research and development program called theÂ Frontier Development Lab. Lucianne Walkowicz, theÂ Astrobiology Chair at the Library of Congress, described one AI-based method as â€œsignal agnostic searchingâ€ atÂ Breakthrough DiscussÂ in 2017. Walkowicz explained that this means using machine learning methods to look at any set of data without predetermined categories and instead let that data cluster into their â€œnatural categories.â€ The software then lets us know what stands out as outliers. These outliers could then be the target of additional investigations. It turns out that SETI researchers think AI might be useful in their work because they believe machine learning is good at spotting difference. But its success depends on how weâ€”and the AI we createâ€”conceptualize the idea of difference. Thinking outside our brains also means thinkingÂ outside our scientific, social and cultural systems. But how can we do that? AI has been used to look forÂ simulations of what researchers imagine alien radio signals might look like, but now SETI researchers hope it can find things we arenâ€™t yet looking for. Graham Mackintosh, an AI consultant at the SETI Institute workshop, said extraterrestrials might be doing things we canâ€™t even imagine, using technologies so different we donâ€™t even think to look for them. AI, he proposed, might be able to do that advanced thinking for us. We may not be able to make ourselves smarter, but perhaps, Mackintosh suggested, we can make machines that are smarter for us. In a keynote at this yearâ€™s Breakthrough Discuss conference, astrophysicist Martin Rees shared a similar hope, that AI could lead to â€œintelligence which surpasses humans as much as we intellectually surpass slime mould.â€ If we met extraterrestrial slime mould, what could we assume about its intelligence? One challenge of SETI is that we donâ€™t know theÂ limits of lifeÂ or intelligence, so we need to beÂ open to all possible forms of difference. We might find intelligence in forms that Euro-American science has historically disregarded: Microbial communities, insects or other complex systems like the symbiotic plant-fungus relationships in mycorrhizal networks thatÂ learn from experience. Intelligence might appear in atmospheres or geology at a planetary scale, or as astrophysical phenomena. What appears to be a background process in the universe, or just part of what we think of as nature, could turn out to be intelligence. Consider that the largest living thing on Earth may be anÂ Armillaria ostoyaeÂ fungusÂ in Eastern Oregonâ€™s Blue Mountains, which extends to 10 square kilometres and is between 2,000 and 9,000 years old. While this fungus may not be what most people think of as intelligence, it reminds us to think about the unexpected when searching for life and intelligence, and of what we might be missing right under our feet. Thinking differently about intelligence means understanding that anything we encounter could be first contact with intelligent life. This might include our first encounter with artificial general intelligence (AGI), also called Strong AI, something closer to the sentient computer HAL 9000 fromÂ 2001: A Space OdysseyÂ or Data fromÂ Star Trek: The Next Generation. As we work with machine learning to expand the SETI search, we also need social sciences to understand how our ideas shape the future of AIâ€”and how AI will shape the future of our ideas. To avoid a human-centred point of view in SETI we need to consider how we encode ideas about difference into AI and how that shapes the outcomes. This is vital for finding and recognizing intelligence as we donâ€™t yet know it. Some of the methods used in anthropology can help us identify ideas about difference that weâ€™ve naturalizedâ€”concepts so familiar they seem invisible, like the divides many still see between nature and culture or biology and technology, for example. Recent research on algorithms reveals how our naturalized ideasÂ shape the technology we create and how we use it. And Microsoftâ€™sÂ infamous AI chat bot TayÂ reminds us the AI we create can easily reflect the worst of those ideas. We may never entirely stop building bias into search engines and search strategies for SETI, or coding it into AI. But through collaborations between scientists and social scientists we can think critically about how we conceptualize difference. A critical, interdisciplinary approach will help us understand how our ideas about difference impact lives, research and possibilities for the future both here on Earth and beyond.

Astronomers Chart 3D Shape Of Musca Cloud For The First Time By Watching It 'Sing'
 Two astronomers determine the 3D structure of the Musca cloud for the first time. The breakthrough step could yield more clues of how exactly stars are formed. The map reveals that the molecular cloud Musca is actually shaped like a pancake despite previous studies saying that Musca is shaped like a needle. With this discovery of its actual shape, the astronomers were also able to study how forces acted on Musca for it to process the creation of stars. Musca lies in the Southern Hemisphere about 500 light-years away from Earth, which is why charting its shape had been challenging for scientists. In general, 3D construction of interstellar clouds or practically all astronomical bodies can only be observed through infrared or 2D projections â€” that is, until this study. For their study, the astronomers specifically chose Musca because its "song" or vibration was unlikely to be affected by other sounds coming from nearby bodies since it was an extremely thin cloud â€” or so they thought. Aris Tritsis, lead author of the study from the University of Crete, and Konstantinos Tassis, senior author and an astrophysicist from the same university, were able to create the full 3D structure of Musca by observing its striations or the translucent patterns made as it moves. These patterns are formed when fast magnetosonic waves or longitudinal magnetic pressure waves were applied. They found that Musca cloud is vibrating, similar to a bell ringing after it has been struck. "We found that Musca is vibrating globally, with the characteristic modes of a sheet viewed edge on, not the characteristics of a filament as previously supposed," the authors writeÂ in the study published in the journal Science. It was a pancake-shaped cloud and not a needle-shaped cloud. With the discovery of its actual shape, the astronomers also gathered that Musca cloud has a lower density than previously thought, which also means that stars formed through it have a different composition. The denser clouds are potentially made up of nitrogen-based molecules such as ammonia, Tassis explains. Also, cloud with less density creates stars at a much lower rate compared with denser clouds. There is a big difference between pancake-like clouds and needle-like clouds. "Magnetic forces make pancake-like clouds, turbulence forms needle-like clouds and thermal forces result in roundish, bobby clouds," Tassis explained. With the precedence set by their study, other scientists have a lower chance of mistaking pancake-shaped clouds from the needle-shaped ones which means they could study more accurately what kind of forces clouds use to form the stars. In the case of Musca, it uses magnetic forces to create stars. Tritsis and Tassis said that with the 3D image of Musca, the cloud can be used to test future theoretical models of more interstellar clouds.

34-million-year-old Skull From Antarctica Reveals Baleen Whales Had Teeth And Gums
 An analysis of an ancient skull reveals that ancient whalesÂ have teeth and gums. The finding suggests that the now friendly animals used to be ferocious predators. The discovery of 34 million-year-old whale skull from Antarctica showed that whales acquire their baleens through a complex and gradual evolution process. It was previously thought that these animals developed their baleens in a more straightforward manner. As it turned out, they first prey on larger victims, lost their teeth, forego biting and learn to suck, until the comb-like baleens structure are developed. Now, the baleen whales feed through filtering massive small prey from seawater and their baleens work more like a strainer. The ancient whale skull belongs to the Llanocetus denticrenatus and was found by Ewan Fordyce, a professor from the University of Otago. He discovered the remains during an expedition in Antarctica. His finding is now believed to be the second-oldest baleen whale ever found. The skull matched the remains found during an earlier expedition done by American researchers in the mid-1970s. This means that the researchers were able to form the puzzle of bones that belonged to the same whale. Fordyce examined the skull with Felix Marx from the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. Their analysis, publishedÂ in the journal Current Biology, stated that Llanocetus denticrenatus is an ancient relative of the humpback and blue whales even if the ancient species seemed to be daunting predators. The relatives, nevertheless, both have distinctive grooves on the roof of their mouths. These grooves contain the blood vessels that support the baleens of the present-day whales. In Llanocetus, those grooves are found around tooth sockets, suggesting a peri-dental blood supply to the gums instead of baleens. Marx says that Llanocetus are huge with a total body length of about 8 meters. The species' teeth are also widely spaced. In the case of the skull found, the tooth has a tear suggesting that it was used to cut prey. "Llanocetus was both large and a ferocious predator and probably had little in common with how modern whales behave," Marx explains. Marx and Fordyce concluded that climate was a big contributor to the history of whale evolution, particularly the change from tropical to cooler weather condition. Possibly, when the weather changes to colder temperatures, the animals' nutrition cycles were altered as well. Hence, the species that the animals used to feed on might have evolved and whales adapted to these supply available to them.

'Lost' asteroid to pass closely May 15
 269,935 subscribers and counting ... Asteroid 2010 WC9 will pass at about half the moonâ€™s distance, in one of the closest approaches ever observed of an asteroid of this size. Click in for information about viewing online. Orbit of asteroid 2010 WC9 (formerly called ZJ99C60) via Asteroid Orbit View and Northolt Branch Observatories. Asteroid 2010 WC9 will safely pass at about halfâ€™s the moonâ€™s distance on Tuesday, May 15, 2018. Estimates of its size range from 197 to 427 feet (60-130 meters), making the May 15 pass one of the closest approaches ever observed of an asteroid of this size. This asteroid was â€œlostâ€ and then found again. The Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona first detected it on November 30, 2010, and astronomers watched it until December 1, when it became too faint to see. They didnâ€™t have enough observations to track its orbit fully and so predict its return. On May 8, 2018 â€“ almost eight years later â€“ astronomers discovered an asteroid and gave it the temporary designation ZJ99C60. Then they realized it was asteroid 2010 WC9, returning. During the 2018 return, closest approach of asteroid 2010 WC9 will happen on May 15 at 22:05 UTC (6:05 pm EDT; translate to your time). At that time, the asteroid will be 0.53 lunar-distances from Earth (126,419 miles or 203,453 km from Earth). According to orbit calculations made by NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the May 15 close approach is the closest of this particular asteroid in nearly 300 years.  Is this a large asteroid? No, not by any absolute measure. But it is larger than the estimated size of the Chelyabinsk meteor, which entered Earthâ€™s atmosphere, breaking windows in six Russian cities and causing some 1,500 people to seek medical attention, in 2013. Estimates of asteroid 2010 WC9â€™s diameter range from 197 to 427 feet (60-130 meters); estimates of the Chelyabinsk meteorâ€™s size before encountering Earthâ€™s atmosphere center around 65 feet (20 meters). Asteroid 2010 WC9 is an Apollo type space rock. At no time will it be visible to the eye as it sweeps past Earth. It might get as bright as magnitude +11, which would make it bright enough to be seen in amateur telescopes pointed at the correct location and time. Asteroid 2010 WC9 is travelling though space at a speed of 28,655 miles per hour (46,116 km/h). Asteroid 2010 WC9 at Minor Planet Center; at CNEOS Want to view the asteroid online? Guy Wells at Northolt Branch Observatories in London, England â€“ which specializes in observations of near-Earth asteroids and other small solar system objects â€“ emailed EarthSky on Friday to say: We are planning to broadcast this asteroid live to our Facebook page on the night of May 14, likely around midnight, if the weather forecast remains positive. The broadcast will be less than 25 minutes in duration, as the asteroid will cross our field of view within that period of time. The asteroid will be moving quite rapidly (30 arcseconds per minute). Our display will update every five seconds. We are of course collecting astrometric data whilst this is happening, but the motion of the asteroid will be apparent every five seconds!  Daniel Bamberger, also at Northolt Branch Observatories, sent along the two images below. He wrote: We imaged this object twice: First on May 9, when it was still known by its temporary designation ZJ99C60; then again on May 10, after it was identified as asteroid 2010 WC9, which had been a lost asteroid for eight years.  It is still a faint object of 18th magnitude, but it is brightening very rapidly: 2010 WC9 will be brighter than 11th magnitude at closest approach, making it visible in a small telescope! Asteroid 2010 WC9 on May 9. Image via Daniel Bamberger/Northolt Branch Observatories. Asteroid 2010 WC9 on May 10. Image via Daniel Bamberger/Northolt Branch Observatories. Bottom line: Asteroid 2010 WC9 will pass at about half the moonâ€™s distance on May 15, 2018. Itâ€™s one of the closest approaches ever observed of an asteroid of this size. Northolt Branch Observatories in London will offer a live viewing of the asteroid on its Facebook page, starting around midnight (London time) on May 14.

Astronomers discover x-ray pulsar with a super fast orbit
  The group of researchers analyzing the initial readings from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) program identified a pair of stars. The pair consisted of an â€œX-ray pulsarâ€ around which the other smaller star orbited in just thirty-eight minutes. The stellar pair has been given the title of the â€œshortest-known orbital period.â€ The binary system is known as IGR J17062â€“6143. The J17062 is situated at around sixteen thousand three hundred light-years ahead of our planet Earth. In accordance with their separation and their orbital period, the researchers of the study believe that the systemâ€™s second star is a â€œwhite dwarfâ€ filled with hydrogen. An astrophysicist of Goddard, Tod Strohmayer, who worked as the lead author of the study said that it is never possible for a star rich in hydrogen (as that of the sun)to act as the companion of Pulsar. He further said that such a star can never get fitted into such a small orbit. The pulsars are regarded as â€œsuperdense neutron stars.â€ These objects possess extreme dense matter, which is on the verge of collapsing into the black holes. These pulsars orbit at astonishing speed rates and seem to spurt at the Earth. The J17062 pulsar is categorized under â€œaccreting millisecond X-ray pulsarsâ€ (AMXP). The AMXPs produce X-rays and possess an orbital period, which never exceeds ten milliseconds. Zaven Arzoumanian, the lead researcher of the NICER, who works as an astrophysicist in the Goddard Space Flight Center at NASA said that from a â€œterrestrialâ€ point of view, the neutron stars are really authentic physics laboratories. The research said that the pulsars, over time would tend to gather much more matter than it is able to handle. Â The surplus mass ultimately would lead to a â€œthermonuclear reaction.â€ This thermonuclear reaction releases x-rays which are actually huge amounts of energies. The NICER is yet to witness such releases from the J17062. The donor star of the pulsar tends to put some effect on the J17062â€™s orbital path. Tod Strohmayer told that the gap in between the pulsar and us is not fixed and rather varies with the orbital motion. He said that at the time when pulsar is nearer, the X-rays reach us within a very less time in comparison to the time when pulsar is far off. The difference in the delay in time is quite less and in case of the J17062â€™s orbit, it is just eight milliseconds. The research about the J17062 would be featured in the Astrophysical Journal in the current week.

Yes, NASA Is Actually Sending a Helicopter to Mars: Here's What It Will Do
 


NASA will include a small, autonomous helicopter in the agency's upcoming Mars 2020 roverÂ mission, officials announced today (May 11). 
	The craft will undergo a 30-day test campaign once it reaches the Red Planet to demonstrate the viability of travel above the Martian surface with a heavier-than-air craft. 
	"NASA has a proud history of firsts," NASA's administrator, Jim Bridenstine, said in a statement. "The idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling. The Mars Helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery and exploration missions to Mars." [Red Planet Express: 10 Ways Robots Move onÂ Mars] 
	The Mars Helicopter's developmentÂ began in 2013 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. It's just under 4 lbs. (1.8 kilograms), and its body is about the size of a softball, NASA officials said in the statement. It will carry solar cells to charge up in the light of the sun and a heating mechanism to endure cold nights on the Red Planet. 
	The helicopter's twin blades will whirl at about 10 times the rate of a helicopter's blades on Earth â€” at 3,000 rpm â€” to stay aloft in Mars' thin atmosphere. 
	"The altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet [12,000 meters]," MiMi Aung, Mars Helicopter project manager at JPL, said in the statement. "The atmosphere of Mars is only one percent that of Earth, so when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it's already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet [30,000 m] up. 
	"To make it fly at that low atmospheric density, we had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be," she added. 
	Mars 2020 is slated to launch in July of that year on United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, and the mission should arrive at Mars in February 2021. The six-wheeled rover will hunt for signs of habitable environments as well as sites that may have once hosted microbial life, examining the Red Planet with 23 cameras, a microphone and a drill to collect samples. 
	The helicopter will ride to Mars attached to the rover's belly pan, officials said. Once the rover reaches the planet's surface, it will place the helicopter on the ground and move to a safe distance to relay commands; controllers on Earth will direct it to take its first autonomous flight. 
	"We don't have a pilot, and Earth will be several light-minutes away, so there is no way to joystick this mission in real time," Aung said. "Instead, we have an autonomous capability that will be able to receive and interpret commands from the ground, and then fly the mission on its own." 
	The helicopter will attempt up to five flights, going farther and operating for longer each time â€” up to a few hundred meters and 90 seconds, officials said. It will also climb to 10 feet (3 m) and hover for about 30 seconds. 
	The Mars Helicopter is considered a high-risk, high-reward project, according to NASA: If the helicopter fails, it won't affect the rest of the Mars 2020 rover's mission, but if it succeeds, the agency will have a powerful new tool to survey the planet and access currently unreachable locations. 
	"Exploring the Red Planet with NASA's Mars Helicopter exemplifies a successful marriage of science and technology innovation and is a unique opportunity to advance Mars exploration for the future," Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C., said in the statement.Â "After the Wright Brothers proved 117 yearsÂ ago that powered, sustained, and controlled flight was possible here on Earth, another group of American pioneers may prove the same can be done on another world. 
	"The ability to see clearly what lies beyond the next hill is crucial for future explorers," he added. "We already have great views of Mars from the surface as well as from orbit. With the added dimension of a bird's-eye view from a 'marscopter,' we can only imagine what future missions will achieve."
