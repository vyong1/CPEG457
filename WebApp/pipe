"The relationship officially ended on November 2017."
It was reported this week that Korea Aerospace Industries paid 
Cohen $150,000 in consulting fees.

Public filings for Demeter Direct in California list Ko as the company's CEO and say the company deals with Korean food.
CNN had reached out to Ko earlier this week to ask whether Demeter Direct had helped arrange Cohen's business consulting deal with Korea Aerospace Industries. Ko responded to the inquiries Friday evening.
Earlier in the week, Korea Aerospace Industries said it received legal advice on the Cost Accounting Standards regulation from Essential Consultants LLC, Cohen's shell company, through a contracted deal. 
"The payment was all legal based on the contract. KAI is doing its best to comply with accounting regulations that are up to global standards," the company said in a statement earlier this week.
A spokesperson clarified that KAI did not have direct contact with Cohen at the time, and that the company had worked with several firms in the US and South Korea to ensure compliance with global accounting standards.
Michael Avenatti, adult film star Stormy Daniels' lawyer, who published information about alleged payments to Cohen earlier this week, had tweeted Friday evening: "In 2017-18 - Why was Mr. Cohen paying Demeter Direct Inc. in Los Angeles large sums of money from his Essential Consultants LLC account?

His client wasn't the President.</h5><p class=card-text>One day after Rudy Giuliani announced he was leaving his law firm to offer his "sole concentration" to President Donald Trump, Giuliani appeared in a Broward County, Florida, courtroom Friday to represent a woman accused in an insurance fraud case.

The former New York City mayor, who recently joined Trump's legal team, appeared for a morning hearing for a criminal defendant. According to court documents, the defendant was in a car crash on May 18, 2016, in Broward County. She is accused of fraudulently purchasing auto insurance online just 10 minutes after the crash and providing false and misleading information to the insurance company.

Two people confirmed Giuliani appeared in court, including Constance Simmons, the public information officer for the state's 17th Judicial Circuit.


    Steve Rossi, the lead Florida attorney representing the defendant, told CNN over the phone Friday that he had never worked with Giuliani before. Asked why the President's attorney is getting involved in an insurance fraud case in Florida, Rossi said Giuliani knows the woman and her family.

"I consider it an honor to have a historical and political icon assisting me on this case," Rossi said. "He is here to help me out and offer his assistance and I more than graciously accepted it."

Rossi added that Giuliani did not mention anything about the President or the fact that he is Trump's lawyer in court. Giuliani was "his usual cordial self," Rossi said.

Giuliani is licensed to practice law in New York but not in Florida, according to court documents. The former New York City mayor requested to work on this case about two weeks after it was announced that he would be joining Trump's legal team, court documents show. He was granted that request May 8.

Reached Friday afternoon, Giuliani said the case was not related to his work for the President. "This is a private client," he told CNN. "I did it as a favor."

He described it as a "minor case" that only took up a half hour in court Friday morning. "I'm cleaning up my law business so I can focus on the President," Giuliani said.


    Trump's legal team didn't comment for this story.

The defendant, Vanessa Ryan, could not be reached for comment. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The affidavit states that after Ryan bought her insurance based on false information, she then filed a fraudulent insurance claim the next day.

In requesting permission to work on the case, Giuliani listed the Manhattan address of his law firm, Greenberg Traurig, as the location of his office.

Giuliani announced Thursday that he had offered a "permanent resignation" from Greenberg Traurig, following what was initially a temporary leave of absence from the firm.


    "In light of the pressing demands of the Mueller investigation, I believe it is in everyone's best interest that I make it a permanent resignation," Giuliani said in a statement, referring to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible Russian collusion in the 2016 election. "This way, my sole concentration can be on this critically important matter for our country."

Richard Rosenbaum, the executive chairman of Greenberg Traurig, said in a statement that there was a recognition that Giuliani's work for Trump was "all consuming and is lasting longer than previously anticipated."

A spokesperson for Greenberg Traurig responded, "This is not a firm matter," when CNN asked about the law firm's role -- if any -- in the case.

Attorney Mike Gottlieb was in the courtroom for a separate case and heard the judge call for Rossi, who was not in the room at the time.

"All of the sudden, in walks this elder statesmen type guy surrounded by about 10 armed guards," Gottlieb said. "That's when I knew something was afoot."

"We cannot speak for Mr. Giuliani with respect to what was intended by his remarks," a spokeswoman for the law firm said in a statement. "Speaking for ourselves, we would not condone payments of the nature alleged to have been made or otherwise without the knowledge and direction of a client." 
The New York Times first reported the statement. 
Giuliani 
announced earlier Thursday that he has resigned from the firm to focus on his legal work for the President. 

The former New York mayor joined the President's legal team last month, and he has since made headlines for his comments regarding the payment made to Daniels. 
In an effort to explain the payment, Giuliani 
said in an interview on "Fox and Friends" last week, "Don't you think a lot of these people would pay that when they can? I represented, I can't disclose who, I represented clients who paid substantially more than that." 

Giuliani added, "If you're wealthy you're a target. We had a case, very famous person, this woman was a professional -- you could do a movie about it -- she was a professional that would hit on rich guys, older ones, and then shake them down for a couple of million bucks." 
During 
a separate interview last week with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Giuliani offered a similar justification for Cohen's transaction.

"Michael would take care of things like this, like I take care of things like this for my clients," he said. "I don't burden them with every single thing that comes along, these are busy people."

Cohen quickly got to work. According to multiple people familiar with Cohen's conduct following the election, he aggressively pitched himself to potential clients, reminding them of his proximity to the most powerful man in the world. Those efforts landed Cohen lucrative consulting deals. New reporting this week revealed that in the months following the 2016 election, Cohen received hundreds of thousands of dollars from powerful entities based in and outside of the United States.
"I don't know who's been representing you, but you should fire them all. I'm the guy you should hire. I'm closest to the President. I'm his personal lawyer," was how one GOP strategist described Cohen's sales pitch.
One company that Cohen immediately sought out was pharmaceutical giant Novartis. "He was shopping himself around," a source familiar told CNN. Cohen would ultimately land a one-year contract with the firm by promising access to the White House on health care policy. 
But that deal quickly soured. According to the source, company officials had one meeting with Cohen in March 2017 and decided that he would not be able to provide the access they desired. There would be no other meetings with Cohen, but Novartis chose to pay out the entirety of Cohen's contract anyway -- $100,000 per month, for a total of $1.2 million. 
Money flowing in
Money was flowing in from other companies, too. Telecommunications conglomerate ATT publicly acknowledged this week that it hired Cohen for a simple reason: to gain "insights" into the new President and his administration. ATT paid Cohen at least $200,000 in 2017, according to a source familiar with the matter.
ATT is seeking government approval for its acquisition of Time Warner, CNN's parent company.
Other payments to Cohen, according to a lawyer suing him, included approximately half-a-million dollars from a company linked to Viktor Vekselberg,
 a Russian oligarch with close ties to the Kremlin and $150,000 from Korea Aerospace Industries. 

Cohen and his lawyer didn't respond to a request for comment on this story. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders wouldn't address the Cohen payments during a briefing with reporters Wednesday.
"As you know due to the complications of the different components of the investigation I would refer you to the outside counsel to address those questions," she told reporters, later adding, "We are not engaging in matters in this process at all."
She said she hasn't heard "specific concerns" from the President on this topic.
While Cohen has not been accused of any wrongdoing, these new revelations raise serious questions about whether a man in Trump's inner circle had engaged in influence peddling and could spell legal trouble for Cohen, who is already in hot water. He is currently under criminal investigation related to his business dealings, 
and federal officials raided his home, office and hotel room last month to seize thousands of pages of documents and records.

Another ominous sign for Cohen: lawyers working with special counsel Robert Mueller on the investigation into possible Russian collusion in the presidential election have questioned at least one company about its contract with Cohen.
"Novartis was contacted in November 2017 by lawyers from the special counsel's office regarding the company's agreement with Essential Consultants. Novartis cooperated fully with the special counsel's office and provided all the information requested," the company said. "Novartis considers this matter closed as to itself and is not aware of any outstanding questions regarding the agreement."
If the revelations about the payments to Cohen are only just coming to light, others in Trump world say they are hardly surprised.
A former Trump campaign official who worked on the transition said "everybody knew" Cohen had taken on consulting work after the election. It was widespread practice among high-ranking Trump associates who did not go into the administration to provide consulting services after Trump won in November 2016, this person said, noting that Cohen was far from the only person to do so.
"You don't need access to (Trump). All you need is the perception of access to (Trump)," the former campaign official said.
Capitalizing on Trump's victory
 
And Cohen wasn't the only one who tried to capitalize on Trump's victory.
Post-election, corporate America was on the hunt for anyone who could help them make inroads with the incoming administration. "There was a lot of scrambling," said one Republican strategist. "C suites everywhere were freaking out."
One person with ties to the campaign described being approached by a top tier tech company after the election with an offer: They would pay this person $50,000 a month to make introductions to members of Trump's team. No lobbying necessary.
Another individual with deep ties to the Washington lobbying world put it this way: "Everyone said Trump won't win. Everyone had all of these Hillary (Clinton) consultants lined up and realized when Trump won, they had nobody." 
Cohen happened to be one person who enjoyed genuine access to the President, one ex-campaign official said. During the transition, Cohen worked out of his office in Trump Tower in Manhattan, where his desk was a three-minute walk from the then-President-elect's office on a nearby floor. Cohen and Trump spoke "multiple times a day" during the transition, this person estimated -- it was during this period that the payments from major corporations first started to flow into Cohen's Essential Consultants bank account.
Trump told reporters last month that Cohen was his lawyer. Cohen has also been seen recently at the President's private club, Mar-a-Lago. Trump has also said that he did hasn't know about the $130,000 payment that 
Cohen made using Essential Consultants to porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleges to have had an affair with Trump years ago. The White House has said Trump denies the affairs.

What's less clear is how much Cohen discussed the nuts and bolts of policy-making with his longtime boss.
One source familiar with Cohen's relationship with Trump said the President "never talked to Cohen about substantive matters" that Cohen's clients would be interested in.
Weakening access 
 
And the proximity that Cohen initially had to Trump during the transition greatly weakened after Inauguration Day, multiple people told CNN. Trump's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, sought to keep Cohen away from the White House, and he was rarely seen there. One person described Cohen as having become "disenfranchised" in the early months of the Trump administration -- but that he nevertheless continued to portray himself as Trump's go-to guy.
The fresh headlines this week about Cohen attempting to line his pockets after the election -- and the perception that he was "harvesting money off of the President's back" -- could ultimately anger Trump, the source noted. 
Robert Weissman, president of public watchdog group Public Citizen, said the precise nature of the work Cohen performed for each client would determine whether he violated any ethics laws.
Weissman cited the $200,000 in payments from ATT to Cohen as an example of a transaction that would only violate laws if Cohen's services went beyond what company representatives have said. ATT has claimed the company only paid Cohen to gain "insights" into the President -- and that there was no legal or lobbying work.
"As a legal matter, if they can stick to that story -- that it was just for strategic advice -- that's probably permissible," Weissman told CNN.
Meanwhile, the $400,000 that Cohen received from Novartis in installments from October 2017 to January 2018 preceded a dinner Trump reportedly had with a Novartis executive in Davos, Switzerland. Weissman suggested the timing of the dinner could raise red flags.
"This agreement was also in now way related to the group dinner Dr. Narasimhan had at the World Economic Forum in Davos with President Trump and 15 Europe based industry leaders," Novartis said in a statement. "Suggestions to the contrary clearly misrepresent the facts and can only be intended to further personal or political agendas as to which Novartis should not be a part."
Novartis has several prominent drugs pending approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Last year, the company secured some high-profile approvals from the FDA. While the drugmaker paid Cohen, it also spent millions of dollars to lobby lawmakers about more than a dozen pieces of legislation, including the Republican tax cut plan, according to federal disclosures.
What's more, Cohen would need to register as a foreign agent if he provided any public policy representation to overseas companies, Weissman added.
Cohen accepted $150,000 from Korea Aerospace Industries, a South Korean company, in November 2017.
In partnership with US defense giant Lockheed Martin, the company is currently vying for a lucrative contract with the United States Air Force, which plans to buy approximately 350 new training jets. The Air Force is considering buying the T-50 Golden Eagle, which is developed by Korean Aerospace Industries. A decision is reportedly expected this spring.
The company told CNN that it retained Cohen to receive "short term legal advice."
"Korea Aerospace Industries, LTD. received legal advice on the Cost Accounting Standards regulation from Essential Consultants, LLC through a contracted deal," a spokesperson said. "The payment was all legal based on the contract. KAI is doing its best to comply with accounting regulations that are up to global standards."
The spokesperson clarified that the company did not have direct contact with Cohen at the time, and that the "deal was done by someone else." It was not immediately clear who this "someone else" was.</p><a href=http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/iJJFCkdqBdc/index.html class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>Stormy Daniels' lawyer: US company linked to Russian oligarch paid $500,000 to Cohen</h5><p class=card-text>"Michael Cohen should not be selling access to the President of the United States," attorney Michael Avenatti said on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" Tuesday night. 
In a memo posted online Tuesday afternoon, Avenatti alleged that Cohen received the following payments after the 2016 election: approximately half-a-million dollars from a company linked to Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch with close ties to the Kremlin; nearly $400,000 from pharmaceutical giant Novartis; $150,000 from Korea Aerospace Industries and $200,000 from telecommunications conglomerate ATT.
ATT is trying to acquire CNN's parent company, Time Warner. The Justice Department sued to prevent the merger in November of last year. Avenatti's documents stated the payments by ATT were made in four amounts of $50,000 each, with two of those payments made before the Justice Department sued to block the merger.
ATT confirmed the payments in a statement to CNN. "Essential Consulting was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration," the company said. "They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017."
Adding to the intrigue: The payments were made to the same bank account that Cohen had created in 2016 to execute the now infamous hush payment to Daniels, Avenatti said.
CNN has reviewed documents that appear to show these payments. CNN has not independently authenticated the documents.
Cohen established the firm Essential Consultants in the weeks leading up to Election Day to make a $130,000 payment to Daniels, as a part of an agreement to prevent the porn star from discussing her alleged affair with Trump. 
The White House has repeatedly denied that Trump and Daniels had an affair.
Cohen has insisted that he used his personal funds to cover those costs and that the Trump campaign and Trump Organization were never a party to the agreement and that neither entity reimbursed him for the $130,000 payment. Last week, Trump's new lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, made the stunning revelation in a Fox News interview that Trump personally reimbursed Cohen for the payment. The former New York City mayor said the payments were made in multiple installments. 
Avenatti's allegation that Cohen received a significant sum of money from a firm tied to Vekselberg soon after the 2016 election raises questions about Cohen's potential connections to Russian interests, as special counsel Robert Mueller has cast a wide net to investigate potential collusion in the 2016 presidential election. 
CNN reported Tuesday evening that Mueller's investigators have questioned Vekselberg about payments his company's US affiliate made to Cohen.

Vekselberg is the chairman of Renova, a Russian investment company. His cousin Andrew Intrater runs Columbus Nova, which a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission describes as Renova's US affiliate.
"Columbus Nova is a management company solely owned and controlled by Americans," Columbus Nova's attorney Richard Owens said in a statement Tuesday night. "After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures. Reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved or provided any funding for Columbus Nova's engagement of Michael Coehn is patently untrue. Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else other than Columbus Nova's owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement."
Vekselberg was one of two oligarchs stopped by FBI agents working for the special counsel when his private plane landed in a New York-area airport earlier this year, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. During the stop, Vekselberg was questioned about the payment to Cohen, one source familiar with the meeting told CNN.
He was also asked about roughly $300,000 in political donations Intrater made to Trump's inauguration and victory funds and the Republican National Committee in 2017, sources told CNN. The donations were unusual for Intrater, who previously donated a combined $3,800 to two candidates, one Republican and one Democrat. Intrater was also interviewed by the special counsel's team, according to sources.
According to Avenatti's memo, pharmaceutical company Novartis made four separate payments of $99,980 to the Essential Consultants bank account in late 2017 to early 2018; Korea Aerospace Industries made a single payment of $150,000 in November 2017; and ATT made four payments of $50,000 from late 2017 to early 2018.
In a statement, Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff said, "Any agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before our current CEO taking office in February of this year and have expired."
Korea Aerospace Industries did not immediately respond for comment.
The memo suggests that federal prosecutors "could be looking to see if Cohen was involved in a multinational crime syndicate," CNN legal analyst Michael Zeldn said. "What was Michael Cohen's business?" Why was he engaged in these transactions?"
The stakes are sky-high for Cohen, who is currently under a federal criminal investigation by the US attorney's office in Manhattan and had his home, hotel room and office raided last month. 
Sources have told CNN that investigators sought and seized documents and records related to a number of issues, including Cohen's various businesses. One source said the warrant also referenced an investigation into wire fraud and bank fraud. CNN previously reported FBI agents removed Cohen's computer, cell phone, business files and financial documents, according to the source.
The FBI also collected recordings Cohen made of his conversations with lawyer Keith Davidson, who previously represented two women -- Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal. Both Daniels and McDougal alleged they had affairs with Trump. 

"This is probably why Cohen's offices were raided," Zeldin, the legal analyst, said about the payments detailed in Avenatti's memo.
Giuliani's claims last week appeared to directly contradict Trump's recent statement that he did not know about Cohen's payment to Daniels.

"The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair," Trump wrote on Twitter. The payment was entirely unrelated to his campaign, Trump added. 

CNN's Eli Watkins contributed to this report.</p><a href=http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/exCvI3zCLD4/index.html class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>Several White House medical unit staffers describe pressure to hand out meds</h5><p class=card-text>Washington (CNN) The White House medical unit frequently functioned as a "grab and go" clinic where mid-level staffers to the most senior officials could obtain prescription drugs without being examined by a doctor , casually pick up the powerful sleeping aid Ambien even for their children, and get drugs that were not prescribed to the person actually taking the medication.

These examples, described to CNN by five of the medical unit's former and current employees and which appear to represent the more problematic practices there, were endorsed by Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, a doctor.

The allegations shine light on a little-known office on White House grounds skirting some of the most basic medical protocols for years, including under former President Barack Obama. The medical unit serves some White House staffers who work around the clock on high-stakes issues and are unable to easily access their own personal physicians for ailments.

Four former and current White House medical unit employees -- all of whom requested anonymity to discuss behavior they witnessed and were aware of during their tenures -- said prescription medication was handed out readily. In fact, sometimes even the most basic medical consultation was unnecessary.

One person who worked at the medical unit under both the Obama and Trump administrations said there was such a "loose control of the controlled medications" that one high-profile Obama administration official who was leaving the White House went to the medical unit for Provigil. The drug promotes alertness and helps individuals stay awake.

It was treated as a "parting gift," the person said, and the outgoing administration official was given around 20 Provigil pills. It is not clear whether this official was ever seen by a White House doctor.

Another of the sources said they witnessed similar requests for pills from outgoing White House staffers. They also recalled being present when one Obama White House staffer came into the outpatient clinic and demanded: "I need to pick up a Z-Pak for myself and my wife."

Z-Pak is the common name for Zithromax, an antibiotic that treats infections. The doctor at the medical unit rejected the request, insisting that the staffer first receive an examination. The doctor was particularly concerned about serious cardiac issues that can result from taking Z-Pak. The staffer grew frustrated, this person recalled, and responded: "Dr. Jackson said I can just pick it up and I don't have to be seen."

Moments later, another colleague walked past the doctor, grabbed the Z-Paks and handed them to the White House staffer.

"You need to just give people these meds when they ask for it," this colleague said -- a message that multiple former medical unit employees said was in line with Jackson's overarching philosophy.

"We would just hand them out. They'd come in and say, 'Hey, can I have an Ambien?' And we would just hand them out. Without having to sign a thing," another person who has recently worked for Jackson told CNN. "We all had a huge problem with it."

Not only was it unnecessary to be examined by a doctor before being handed prescription medication, sometimes, prescriptions were written out for a different person than the intended recipient, according to three former employees with knowledge of the practice.

"People in the unit can pick it up and hand it out to staffers," one person said. "Jackson himself is directing people to do that."

Two people mused that sometimes this was done to protect the identity of a high-profile administration official who needed certain medications.

'Out to get him'

Some former Obama administration officials are defending Jackson, saying they were only given sleeping aids after being asked routine medical questions. He would ask staffers how long they wanted to sleep and whether they had to get any work done on the flight, before offering drugs ranging from Ambien to non-prescription drugs like melatonin.

"The people who are calling him 'the Candyman' are out to get him," one of the officials said. "White House staffers were expected to make transatlantic flights sleeping on the floor. It wasn't just him."

All interviewees for this story were directly contacted by CNN as accusations about Jackson's management of the clinic have come to light. They agreed to anonymously share what they said were their deep concerns about some of the practices at the unit, which they felt Jackson was responsible in large part for.

Jackson did not respond to a request for comment from CNN for this story. In withdrawing his nomination Thursday morning, Jackson said the range of allegations made against him were "completely false and fabricated."

"If they had any merit, I would not have been selected, promoted and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as physician to three presidents over the past 12 years," he said. "In my role as a doctor, I have tirelessly worked to provide excellent care for all my patients. In doing so, I have always adhered to the highest ethical standards."

The White House did not respond to a CNN request for comment. A spokesperson for former President Barack Obama also declined to comment.

The practice of casually handing out medication like Ambien and Provigil was not limited to the confines of the White House compound. Several former medical unit staffers said the drugs were freely dispensed on Air Force One.

The distribution of Ambien and Provigil on flights -- including to journalists -- has long been a widespread and accepted practice throughout the US government, including on White House, Defense Department and State Department trips.

Jackson told reporters in a January news conference that Trump himself takes Ambien "on occasion" on overseas travel.

"When we travel from one time zone to another time zone on the other side of the planet, I recommend that everyone on the plane take a sleep aid at certain times so that we can try our best to get on the schedule of our destination," Jackson said.

Multiple health experts stressed the importance of properly screening for drug interactions, documenting what is prescribed and monitoring for habit formation and complications when physicians prescribe medications like Ambien or Provigil.

"Giving out Ambien or Provigil sleep aids 'like candy' as alleged is still dangerous and irresponsible because these drugs have notorious side effects," said Art Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at the New York University School of Medicine. "You really don't want to be cavalier about it. These drugs are prescription for a reason -- not the same as an over-the-counter drug."

Dr. Anna Lembke, an associate professor at Stanford University and chief of their addiction medicine clinic, told CNN: "I would never prescribe a drug like that to somebody outside of clinical care. Even within clinical care, I'm very careful about how I use that class of medications."

Those who have worked directly under Jackson insist that Jackson's practices made them uncomfortable. His propensity for doling out medication sent staffers at the medical unit into a frenzy more than once, with multiple people describing a "scrambling" to account for missing medication. Keeping close tabs on how many drugs are dispensed was a practice that simply did not exist at the White House medical unit, they said.

"There was none of that here. It freaked a lot of us here," said the person who has recently worked for Jackson.

Another concerning revelation: White House staffers could easily pick up prescription medication for their children who were accompanying them on official trips. One person described it as "standard practice" for parents to pick up Ambien for their children, while another said they heard about the practice of giving parents Ambien and Provigil for their children from multiple physicians and nurses.

"Some of the stuff they would do for civilian staff members would get really excessive sometimes," one person said. There was a culture of "bending over backwards," they added, "to treat these people."</p><a href=http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/dChk5DTpK1I/index.html class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>Judge hears arguments to delay Stormy Daniels case</h5><p class=card-text>Washington (CNN) Stormy Daniels' attorney said he plans to "vehemently argue" on Friday against the attempt from President Donald Trump and his attorney Michael Cohen to delay her lawsuit.

"We will appear in the morning and vehemently argue against the attempt by Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump to delay this case. The American people deserve the truth as quickly as possible. #basta," Michael Avenatti tweeted Thursday.

US District Court Judge S. James Otero scheduled a hearing for Friday where Avenatti will argue the case.

Daniels filed a lawsuit in March to void a contract she signed days before the 2016 general election in which she agreed to stay quiet about her alleged 2006 affair with Trump. The White House has said Trump denies the affair.

She is arguing that the agreement should be nullified because Trump himself never signed the document.

Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 at the time, a payment which Cohen alleges was made using his personal funds and out of personal loyalty to the President but has raised red flags among campaign finance experts and drawn the scrutiny of federal investigators.

FBI agents raided Cohen's home, hotel room and office last week as part of what was ultimately revealed to be an ongoing criminal investigation into his business dealings. According to sources, investigators were seeking information about a range of issues, including Cohen's 2016 hush agreement with Daniels.

They are also seeking records related to a deal between ex-Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal and American Media Inc., which prevented her from publicly discussing her alleged 10-month affair with Trump, and the infamous "Access Hollywood" tape that came to light weeks before the 2016 election, which captured Trump making lewd remarks about women.

Lawyers for Cohen and Trump asked a judge to delay proceedings in the Daniels lawsuit, pointing to the open criminal investigation into Cohen. They are making the case that the Daniels case moving forward could hurt Cohen's Fifth Amendment rights. Core to their concern is that whatever Cohen says in the Daniels proceedings could be used against him in the criminal investigation.

If the judge grants the request from Trump and Cohen, Daniels' lawsuit could be delayed while the investigation continues.

Avenatti argues that Cohen has already given up his Fifth Amendment rights by publicly discussing the Daniels case.

Asked about Cohen's $130,000 payment to Daniels earlier this month, Trump said he did not know about the transaction.

Pressed on why Cohen would have made such a payment, Trump responded: "You'll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney. You'll have to ask Michael."</p><a href=http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/1btJ4bIrbmc/index.html class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>Stormy Daniels releases sketch of man who allegedly threatened her over Trump affair</h5><p class=card-text>The disclosure of the drawing and the announcement of the monetary reward on ABC's "The View" mark yet another theatrical twist in the dramatic public feud between the porn star and President Donald Trump. Daniels alleges that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and that she signed a secret agreement just days before the 2016 election in exchange for the promise to stay quiet about the alleged affair. She is now suing Trump in the hopes of voiding that agreement.

The development also comes at a grave moment for a key figure in the Daniels saga -- Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. Cohen claims to have orchestrated the non-disclosure agreement with Daniels and says he used $130,000 of his own money to pay her off. Last week, the FBI raided Cohen's home, office and hotel room in New York City. Sources said authorities seized information related to Stephanie Clifford, Daniels' legal name, and that the search included bank records.

Daniels, recounting the alleged 2011 incident on "The View," said that what she remembers "so clearly about him was that nothing looked alarming about the way he looked at first."

At the top of the sketch, it states that the man is between 5'9" and 6' tall, between his 30s and early 40s, and with a lean but "fit" body type.

Daniels says the alleged threat took place in 2011, shortly after she had agreed in May of that year to sell her story about Trump to a magazine for $15,000. In a previous interview with Anderson Cooper on CBS' "60 Minutes," Daniels said she was in a Las Vegas parking lot preparing to head into a fitness class when a man approached her and her infant daughter. Legal fees made up more than 20% of Trump's campaign spending so far this year "A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,'" Daniels told "60 Minutes." "And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone." "I was rattled," she added. "I remember going into the workout class. And my hands are shaking so much, I was afraid I was going to drop her." On "The View," Daniels said one of the main reasons she did not go to the police after the incident was that she had not disclosed her alleged affair with Trump to her husband and was "embarrassed." Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said on "The View" he and Daniels think they know who sent the man who allegedly confronted her, "but we want to confirm it." Avenatti has told CNN that the person who made the threat was not Cohen or Trump's longtime bodyguard, Keith Schiller. Cohen's attorney has denied that his client had any involvement in or knowledge of the threat. Daniels said she never went to the police about the incident and never saw the man again, but that she is certain she would be able to recognize him. "I would know it right away," she said. "Even now, all these years later. If he walked in this door right now, I would instantly know." The sketch was drawn by Lois Gibson, a forensic artist whose bio claims that she has helped law enforcement identify 700 criminals with her sketches. Exclusive: FBI seized recordings between Trump's lawyer and Stormy Daniels' former lawyer Following federal investigators' seizure of Cohen's documents last week, Trump's lawyers had asked that they get a chance to first review all documents and decide what should be off-limits due to attorney-client privilege. Cohen's lawyers, meanwhile, sought a temporary restraining order to prevent investigators from reviewing the material and requested that a third party special master decide what investigators can see.. that Cohen's lawyers will get a chance to review the seized materials and declare what they think should be protected under attorney-client privilege and that Trump's lawyers could similarly weigh in on records relevant to the President.
