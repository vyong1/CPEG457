Puerto Rican officials announced emergency storm preparedness plans on Thursday, less than a month before the next hurricane season begins. The island is still recovering from hurricanes Irma and Maria.

Officials said at a press conference that they have plans to distribute satellite phones and radios as backup communications systems to emergency management offices, police and fire stations, and hospitals by the end of the month.
Gov. Ricardo Rosselló also announced a partnership between Airbnb and the island's tourism corporation and has met with Facebook, Uber, and solar electricity company Sunrun.
"It’s important that the public knows that the government is prepared and that we have updated these protocols that we’ve been working on, and with FEMA, to be able to increase our capacity to face the next hurricane," Rosselló told reporters at the press conference over Skype. "We are ready to respond in a more effective manner."
Warehouses in four locations across the island will also be stocked with water, food, and other essential supplies for local officials to access in a disaster. Heads of emergency management agencies across the island will also be accredited with the emergency response training used by FEMA staff.
Officials said they're still looking for warehouse facilities in the mountains and on the islands of Vieques and Culebra, areas that were cut off from outside help after Hurricane Maria for several days.

"Maria taught us a lot. Before Maria, we did not have any supply warehouses. We just had FEMA supplies. But for this coming hurricane season we will have four different points of distribution," said Carlos Acevedo, head of PREMA, Puerto Rico's emergency management agency. "The municipalities will know ahead of time where to go to get supplies. These aren't just warehouses in case of a hurricane. We should be prepared 365 days a year. We also don't know when we could be hit by an earthquake or a tsunami."
The agency will also publish a "family plan" online and in paper pamphlets urging Puerto Ricans to follow the guidelines and make a plan in case of another disaster, he added.

The guidelines will be updated to suggest people have supplies to sustain them for 10 days instead of the previous recommendation of three days.
Acevedo added that a test of all emergency systems is planned for June 19 and 20, as well as a meeting with mayors and heads of emergency management agencies to confirm that they're aware of the latest protocols.
However, nearly eight months after Hurricane Maria completely incapacitated the island's electricity and cellular networks and left millions without drinking water, reporters at the press conference and a disaster preparedness expert who spoke to BuzzFeed News questioned the government's readiness.

More than 20,000 households and businesses on the island still don't have electricity, and parts of the island that have had their service reestablished are prone to power cuts, including a major islandwide blackout last month. Thousands of homes still have temporary tarps covering holes in their roofs and some roads still have not been cleared.
"We’re hearing practically the same thing we heard before Irma and Maria — 'We’re prepared. We have a plan,'" said one reporter. "But we didn't really have a plan, not to confront a Category 5 hurricane or a hurricane of any kind."
When asked how he expects residents who have yet to recover from Maria to trust in the government this time around, Pesquera said officials were telling residents "not just that we are prepared, but how we are prepared."
"We all learned from Maria. You all learned from Maria. We all learned. So we’re taking corrective measures now," he said, adding that the hurricane in Puerto Rico was unlike any previously seen in the rest of the US and that all agencies had to develop new ways of dealing with it.
Pressed on whether they could assure Puerto Ricans that electricity and other essential services are stable enough to withstand the coming hurricane season, officials said they could not address "technical details" and that individual agencies will hold press conferences in coming months.
Irwin Redlener, director of Columbia University's National Center for Disaster Preparedness, told BuzzFeed News that if the measures the government laid out on Thursday had been in place last year, it could have minimized the disaster that followed Hurricane Maria to some extent.

But, he said, without building a more resilient power grid, with more underground cables, microgrids, and renewable backup systems, the island is still in serious danger if another major storm hits.
"One of the things that’s fundamental here is the resiliency of the critical systems. So the warehousing and training emergency management and radio systems is all fine but the electrical grid for example is still extraordinarily vulnerable here," he said.
Redlener pointed to US Army Corps of Engineers and PREPA promises in the months immediately after the hurricane to build a more resilient energy grid. But making improvements seems to have taken a backseat to just trying to patch up the network to get it up and running, he said.
Many homes and businesses are also still not fully repaired from September's storm damage, leaving them exposed for any future storms, he added.
"We just came down from the mountains. There are still plenty of houses with blue tarps. There are all kinds of damaged buildings with debris," he said.

Another reporter at the press conference asked if there are plans in place to prevent the gasoline shortage that led to people lining up for hours on end for limited fuel supplies.

"There was never a shortage of gasoline," Pesquera said. "There was an inability to distribute it."
He went on to say that the government can't plan for everything; he added that in some cases roads were impassable and in others gasoline delivery truck drivers were unavailable because they were busy tending to their families during the crisis.
Redlener said the region is expecting 15 to 20 hurricanes this year. Although Hurricane Maria was considered a storm of rare intensity and caused such extensive damage because it passed directly through Puerto Rico, he said the frequency and intensity of storms are increasing as a result of climate change, which also makes it harder to predict exactly what's in store for the coming season.
"We’re facing a serious situation here and we’re all just hoping that Puerto Rico doesn’t get hit again like it was last year," he said.

Now It's Sending Them Home — But They're Not Ready To Go.</h5><p class=card-text>Puerto Rican students who were accepted into an NYU program for Hurricane Maria survivors are asking the school to extend their stay for one more semester because they're frustrated with the island's slow pace of storm recovery and are concerned about the economic instability they'd return to.

"Long story short, the crisis isn’t over. They're saying that this program was an emergency response to the disaster that my institution was facing. It's not a past-tense thing; it's very present," said Amanda Conyers-Godreau, a 19-year-old sophomore majoring in interdisciplinary studies at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey.
The Hurricane Maria Assistance Program (HMAP) was open to students at several colleges in Puerto Rico, giving them an opportunity to study at NYU for the spring semester in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria's widespread destruction. They paid tuition at their home institutions and NYU provided housing, food, health insurance, and $200 credit at the university bookstore.

At least three other universities, Tulane, Cornell, and Brown, offered similar programs during the spring semester.
The program expires when the semester finishes in the coming weeks — students are expected to return home when their classes and exams finish. But 25 students in NYU's program say that conditions are still so unstable at home that they're not sure they'll be able to continue with their studies if they have to go back for the coming semester.
"The HMAP program was established in order for us to continue our studies while our home institutions, and country, recovered from the destruction witnessed by the world after the passing of Hurricane Maria," the students wrote in a letter to NYU president Andrew Hamilton on April 27, first reported by NYU student publication Washington Square News.






    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
    


  
  





"Like you," they continued, "we hoped our country and home institutions would have returned to their pre-natural-disaster state by this time. Unfortunately, the efforts to rebuild our Puerto Rico have been superficial at best and neglectful at worst."
While most universities on the island are now open and operating at some capacity, the students say going back to the frequent power outages, coming hurricane season, and economic turmoil on the island is daunting.

"We humbly request that you consider the reality under which HMAP was first conceptualized, compare it to the one we face today, and then consider our proposal to extend the program from its original one-semester plan to a two-semester plan," they wrote in the letter.
Another student who signed the letter, Carlos Gabriel Matos, is a 20-year-old electrical engineering major and sophomore at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez, on the island's west coast. He said he's had severe anxiety since living through the hurricane and the power and water outages that followed. He couldn't contact his family for days after the storm, and spent months afterward trying to care for his mother and grandmother, who both had medical emergencies.
"It was a chain reaction, which kind of has left me unstable. When I came here I left my university, but my studies were already affected because of my anxiety. I had to drop two out of four topics," he said, adding that seeing a counselor and being in a stable environment at NYU has helped him work through some of that. "I am going back only because I don't have a choice."
Hamilton, NYU's president, wrote back to the students on May 2, denying their request. Still, the students are hoping the school will change its policy.
In his letter, Hamilton said NYU had heard from some of the students' home institutions that they would not support extending the program, and that it "was always intended to be an emergency response, for a single semester."

"NYU’s program, like our fellow universities’ initiatives, was launched in hopes of making it possible for you to continue to pursue your degree in the face of curricular interruptions back home, and in hopes of making it easier for campuses in Puerto Rico to reopen. In particular, we strove to structure HMAP so as to minimize any unintended ill effects to your home institutions in Puerto Rico," Hamilton wrote.
"Based on our conversations with representatives from schools in Puerto Rico, we believe that extending our program would in fact cause harm to their own recovery efforts, and we know they are relying on each of you to play an important role in that work," he wrote.
NYU declined to comment when BuzzFeed News asked how much the program cost.
There were 57 Puerto Rican students in total accepted into NYU's HMAP program, according to NYU, out of which more than 40 were students from the University of Puerto Rico system, the largest group of public universities on the island.
The University of Puerto Rico, which has 11 campuses, sustained around $132 million worth of damage in total from hurricanes Maria and Irma, according to the UPR 2018 Fiscal Plan. Total enrollment at UPR dropped from 61,748 in the 2017 financial year to 58,402 in the 2018 financial year.
University of Puerto Rico officials did not respond to requests for comment but sent a statement to NYU, which was forwarded to BuzzFeed News, which states that the agreement between the schools was limited to the spring semester and adding that all campuses are "fully functional" and ready to receive students.

“The UPR Leadership is grateful for the solidarity demonstrated by NYU hosting a group of our students with a "special visitor" status for the academic year 2017-2018 ... This constituted a post-hurricane relief effort. At this time all of the UPR System and its 11 Campuses are fully functional and thus ready to receive these students for the next academic year 2018-2019," the statement said. "We understand that there is no need for these students to continue receiving relief aid offered by Mainland colleges."

Josh Taylor, associate vice chancellor of Global Programs at NYU, oversaw the program. He told BuzzFeed News on Monday that students were welcome to apply for a transfer to NYU if they wanted to, but said the school is also wary of poaching high-achieving students from Puerto Rican universities.
"If they have applied [for a transfer], got in and are able to make it work financially and logistically then that would be one option," he said.
Conyers-Godreau said she's applied to transfer to NYU, but she thinks the financial burden would be too much, even if she receives some aid from the school.






    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
    



  
  





"It's very clear to me that the financial aid that I would need to get is nowhere near the amount that I would need, so I would be in considerable debt," she said. She has also applied to the Parsons School of Design, the University of Southern Florida, and the Savannah College of Art and Design.
The students say they're not sure if they will be able to continue their studies when they go back home, between trying to support themselves through college during an economic crisis and the still-unstable infrastructure of the island.
"When I get back home I don’t know what will happen," said Priscilla Malavet, 21, a journalism student and junior at UPR Río Piedras in San Juan. "I’m in the honors program, and we have to take certain classes to complete a thesis. I think I have to drop out of being an honors student because doing classes and a thesis, I cannot pay for it. It’s not just my classes — it’s paying for gas, electricity, apartment, water. It’s a lot of things you have to do."






    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
    



  
  





She said she'll try to finish her degree as soon as possible and then apply for a graduate degree or a job somewhere outside Puerto Rico. She's still reeling from the stressful situation she left behind. The retail store she worked at closed for a month and a half, cutting off her income. And when she went back she was working close to 40 hours per week to try to make up for the loss of income, while also juggling six classes.

"I would literally get to my job, close the door and cry a little bit, then go out and start working," she said.
On top of Puerto Rico's struggle to permanently fix the electric grid, the University of Puerto Rico is facing a turbulent period financially: As part of the Puerto Rican government's attempt to manage the debt crisis, public universities will raise tuition significantly. For undergraduate students, the cost of one credit will rise from $57 to $115 in the coming year, and will continue rising to $157 per credit by 2023.






    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
    



  
  





In March last year, a strike protesting the changes shut down University of Puerto Rico schools for several months. The federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board, tasked with overseeing the island's financial affairs during the debt crisis, approved the tuition increases in April. Students say there's already talk of more potentially debilitating protests at the campuses they're returning to.
"NYU has resources that right now the UPR system doesn’t have, and what’s happening now with the rising tuition just to assuage the debt, we’re going to have the same terrible infrastructure — we’re not going to have more classes, or more professors," said Malavet.

For Angela Elliston, 20, a junior studying art history and creative writing at UPR Río Piedras, the past few months at NYU gave her a sense of security, which she's worried will be hard to find back home in Puerto Rico right now.

"It felt like stability for the first time in a long time. Because after the hurricane I just didn’t know what was going to happen with my future; everything was just a mess," she said. "It's funny, but even having homework was such a relief — I felt like I was back on track."</p><a href=https://www.buzzfeed.com/nidhiprakash/nyu-students-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria?bfsplash&utm_term=4ldqpho class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>NYU Took In Students From Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria. Now It's Sending Them Home — But They're Not Ready To Go.</h5><p class=card-text>Puerto Rican students who were accepted into an NYU program for Hurricane Maria survivors are asking the school to extend their stay for one more semester because they're frustrated with the island's slow pace of storm recovery and are concerned about the economic instability they'd return to.

"Long story short, the crisis isn’t over. They're saying that this program was an emergency response to the disaster that my institution was facing. It's not a past tense thing, it's very present," Amanda Conyers-Godreau, a 19-year-old sophomore majoring in interdisciplinary studies at the University of Puerto Rico, Cayey.
The Hurricane Maria Assistance Program (HMAP) was open to students at several colleges in Puerto Rico, giving them an opportunity to study at NYU for the spring semester in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria's widespread destruction. They paid tuition at their home institutions and NYU provided housing, food, health insurance, and $200 credit at the university bookstore.

At least three other universities, Tulane, Cornell, and Brown offered similar programs during the spring semester.
The program expires when the semester finishes in the coming weeks — students are expected to return home when their classes and exams finish. But 25 students in NYU's program say that conditions are still so unstable at home that they're not sure they'll be able to continue with their studies if they have to go back for the coming semester.
"The HMAP program was established in order for us to continue our studies while our home institutions, and country, recovered from the destruction witnessed by the world after the passing of Hurricane María," the students wrote in a letter to NYU president Andrew Hamilton on April 27.






    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
  
    


  
  





"Like you," they continued, "we hoped our country and home institutions would have returned to their pre-natural-disaster state by this time. Unfortunately, the efforts to rebuild our Puerto Rico have been superficial at best and neglectful at worst."
While most universities on the island are now open and operating at some capacity, the students say going back to the frequent power outages, coming hurricane season, and economic turmoil on the island is daunting.

"We humbly request that you consider the reality under which HMAP was first conceptualized, compare it to the one we face today, and then consider our proposal to extend the program from its original one-semester plan to a two-semester plan," they wrote in the letter.
Another student who signed the letter, Carlos Gabriel Matos, is a 20-year-old electrical engineering major and sophomore at the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez, on the island's west coast. He said he's had severe anxiety since living through the hurricane and the power and water outages that followed. He couldn't contact his family for days after the storm, and spent months afterwards trying to care for his mother and grandmother who both had medical emergencies.
"It was a chain reaction which kind of has left me unstable. When I came here I left my university but my studies were already affected because of my anxiety, I had to drop two out of four topics," he said, adding that seeing a counsellor and being in a stable environment at NYU has helped him work through some of that. "I am going back only because I don't have a choice."
Hamilton, NYU's president, wrote back to the students on May 2, denying their request. Still, the students are hoping the school will change its policy.
In his letter, Hamilton said NYU had heard from some of the students' home institutions that they would not support extending the program, and that it "was always intended to be an emergency response, for a single semester."

"NYU’s program, like our fellow universities’ initiatives, was launched in hopes of making it possible for you to continue to pursue your degree in the face of curricular interruptions back home, and in hopes of making it easier for campuses in Puerto Rico to reopen. In particular, we strove to structure HMAP so as to minimize any unintended ill effects to your home institutions in Puerto Rico," Hamilton wrote.
"Based on our conversations with representatives from schools in Puerto Rico, we believe that extending our program would in fact cause harm to their own recovery efforts, and we know they are relying on each of you to play an important role in that work," he wrote.
NYU declined to comment when BuzzFeed News asked how much the program cost.
There were 57 Puerto Rican students in total accepted into NYU's HMAP program, according to NYU, out of which more than 40 were students from the University of Puerto Rico system, the largest group of public universities on the island.
The University of Puerto Rico, which has 11 campuses, sustained around $132 million worth of damage in total from Hurricanes Maria and Irma, according to the UPR 2018 Fiscal Plan. Total enrollment at UPR dropped from 61,748 in the 2017 financial year to 58,402 in the 2018 financial year.
University of Puerto Rico officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Josh Taylor, associate vice chancellor of Global Programs at NYU, oversaw the program. He told BuzzFeed News on Monday that students were welcome to apply for a transfer to NYU if they wanted to, but said the school is also wary of poaching high-achieving students from Puerto Rican universities.

Kanewakeron Thomas Gray, 19, and Skanahwati Lloyd Gray, 17, joined a campus tour group on Monday that they had registered for online a week before. On the day, they joined the tour group late after getting lost on the unfamiliar campus. About 15 minutes later, a woman on their tour called 911.

"I was just thinking, what did I do to get in trouble," Skanahwati Lloyd Gray, a senior at Santa Fe Indian School, told BuzzFeed News on Saturday. "It makes me pretty pissed because I wasn't doing anything. I was just acting like my normal self and I feel like I didn't deserve to be taken off just for that."

He said he arrived on the campus with his brother, a freshman at Northern New Mexico College, and checked in with one of the admissions offices. They were told to join the tour, which was in progress.

In audio released by CSU police, the woman who called 911 can be heard telling the operator, "They're definitely not a part of the tour and their behavior is just really odd."

"They won't give their names and when I asked them what they wanted to study, like everything they were saying, they were lying the whole time," said the caller, identified as a 45-year-old white woman, whose name is redacted, in a police report.



She went on to describe their clothing as having "weird symbolism or wording on it" and, asked by the operator if they were white males, she said, "I think they're Hispanic. I believe, one of them for sure, he said he's from Mexico."

The woman on the call went on to say, "When I asked what they wanted to study I could tell they were making stuff up." In a second call to 911, she said another person on the tour "also believes they don't belong."



The brothers, both musicians and heavy metal fans, were wearing black on the day—Thomas wore a t-shirt from one of his favorite bands, Cattle Decapitation, a band that advocates for animal rights. They had saved up money for weeks to make the seven-hour trip from their home in Santa Cruz, New Mexico, to Fort Collins. They were excited to see the campus partly because it's near Denver's live music scene.

In body cam footage also released by CSU police on Friday, officers can be seen patting both teenagers down, asking if they were part of the group and how they joined the group.

"The reason we stopped you and talked to you is because someone from the group called and said you guys just kind of came into the group," the officer can be heard saying. "They also said they tried to ask you guys questions and you didn’t want to answer questions.”</p><a href=https://www.buzzfeed.com/nidhiprakash/a-woman-called-the-cops-on-two-native-american-teens-taking?bfsplash&utm_term=4ldqpho class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>A Woman Called The Cops On Two Native American Teens Taking A College Tour Because They Were "Real Quiet"</h5><p class=card-text>Two Native American teenagers were removed from a Colorado State University campus tour and questioned by police after a woman in their tour group called 911 because they were "real quiet" and she believed they "don't belong."

“They’re separating families completely. They’re getting rid of the strongest support and path to rehabilitation that they have,” Madeline Gotay, 60, the mother of two men serving time in a Puerto Rican prison, told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday.

Her sons are at the Bayamon Correctional Complex, about a 45 minute drive from where she lives in Trujillo Alto. She said being able to visit them once a week has been a lifeline for them — and for her — while they’ve been serving time for the past 1o years.

“The only help that they have in the jail is the help that their family gives them, to be able spend time with them one hour per week. There are lots of hugs and kisses. We talk about how everyone in the family is doing, my mother, their sister, all the family news,” Gotay said. “And we talk about how they are doing in jail, emotionally. Definitely it’s the most indispensable part of their rehabilitation. It gives them strength in their hearts.”

Her sons, Freddy Fraticelli Gotay, 34, and Juan Moraza Gotay, 30, are serving 50 years for second-degree murder and 28 years for intent to murder and possession of weapons, respectively.

If her sons were moved away from the island, she said, like most families she knows with loved ones in prison, “I wouldn’t be able in any way go. We would lose them. How would I go to see them? There’s no money, no way to pay for those flights.”

Moving the inmates is part of a series of cost-saving measures outlined in Puerto Rican 2018 fiscal plan, which was approved by the federally-appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board last week. The agency will move 3,200 — about a third of the island’s incarcerated population — to private prisons on the mainland over the next five years. The oversight board has ordered the department to cut $395 million from its budget by 2023.

In a letter released on Wednesday morning, the ACLU of Puerto Rico and 33 lawyers, civil rights professors, social workers, and advocates, said they oppose the move because it would ”substantially affect the process of rehabilitation of inmates and cause anguish and suffering to their families and friends as the ties preserved through their visits will be broken.”

The advocates and lawyers say they believe the move will reduce prisoners’ access to the Puerto Rican court system, and questions what will happen to prisoners if they end up in private prisons in the US and ultimately decide they want to return home upon release.



“Having committed a crime is not an excuse to dispose of people without considering their well-being and that of their relatives,” the letter added.</p><a href=https://www.buzzfeed.com/nidhiprakash/puerto-rico-thousands-inmates-private-prisons-united-states class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>A Sixth Body Has Been Found Near Where A Family Plunged Off A Cliff In Their Van</h5><p class=card-text>A sixth body has been found in near the site in California where a couple and their six adopted children plunged off a cliff in their van last month.



The Mendocino County Sheriff's office said in a statement that the body on African-American female was found in the surf on Saturday near where the Hart family's van was found on March 26.

A couple spotted the body floating in the surf on Saturday, and another bystander pulled it onto the beach and called the local fire department, who alerted the sheriff's office.



The bodies of the two parents, Jennifer and Sarah Hart, and three of their children were found in the van, but three other children remain still missing, including 15-year-old Devonte Hart, whose photo hugging a white police officer during an anti-police violence protest went viral in 2014. Hannah, 16, and Sierra, 15, have also not been found.

Authorities have not been able to positively identify the body found on Saturday, but said the sheriff's office is "investigating the possibility that the body may be one of the two missing Hart girls."

An autopsy will be conducted on Tuesday, but authorities warned identifying the body will likely be done through DNA analysis which can take several weeks.</p><a href=https://www.buzzfeed.com/nidhiprakash/hart-family-mendocino-california-body-found-missing-children class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>An IRS Agent Allegedly Handcuffed An Intern In His Car And Then Raped Her</h5><p class=card-text>An IRS agent pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges that he handcuffed an intern, shoved a gun down her throat, and then raped her in his car.



James R. Clarke, a 44-year-old IRS criminal investigations officer, was indicted by a Suffolk County Grand Jury in March on charges of aggravated rape, rape, indecent assault and battery, strangulation, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.



Prosecutors say Clarke invited a 21-year-old student intern out for drinks after work at a nearby pub in Boston and then offered to drive her to the city's South Station to catch a train home.



Once they were in the car, Clarke allegedly handcuffed the intern — who authorities have not identified — "under the guise of showing her what it was like given her interest in law enforcement work", according to a statement from the district attorney's office. He then allegedly shoved his gun so far down her mouth that she suffered an injury to the top of her throat, Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney Ian Polumbaum said during the arraignment.



Clarke told investigators his gun "might have brushed against her face when he showed it to her," Polumbaum told the court.



Forensic testing, however, detected amylase — a main component of saliva — in a swab collected from the surfaces of the gun, and at the time of her hospital exam, the victim had a fresh injury to the uvula at the top of her throat, prosecutors said.



Clarke then allegedly raped her repeatedly, telling her "that she liked pain," prosecutors told the court. After driving her to South Station, prosecutors said he also allegedly pushed her head down in "an additional assaultive act."

The woman told investigators she did not resist out of fear.



An IRS spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in a statement that they "cannot comment on specifics involving these serious and disturbing allegations." They also did not say whether Clarke is still an active IRS agent or answer questions about whether he had faced disciplinary action since the allegations surfaced.

"The IRS holds our employees to high standards, and we do not tolerate inappropriate behavior," the spokesperson said in the statement. "The IRS treats allegations of employee misconduct seriously, and we work cooperatively with local law-enforcement authorities and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration whenever questions arise."

A lawyer for Clarke, Michael Doolin, did not respond to a request for comment, but told reporters at the court after the arraignment that his client has “been completely cooperative with the police department throughout this," adding, “he’s an outstanding individual."



Clarke was released on his own recognizance, meaning no bail was imposed, and ordered to not have contact with the intern or witnesses. His next hearing is scheduled for May.</p><a href=https://www.buzzfeed.com/nidhiprakash/irs-agent-intern-rape-case class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>Trump Just Seemed To Repeat His Comments That Mexicans Are Rapists</h5><p class=card-text>During comments ostensibly about the new tax law in West Virginia on Thursday, President Trump reiterated his comment from the launch of his presidential campaign that Mexicans are "rapists."

"Remember my opening remarks at Trump Tower when I opened," he said Thursday. "Everybody said, oh, he was so tough. I used the word rape. Yesterday it came out where this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before." He was referencing the caravan of asylum-seekers, mostly from Honduras, who are currently heading north in Mexico.

Trump appeared to be saying that the caravan was somehow responsible for the rape of women. There is no evidence this is true.

Trump, when he announced his campaign, said, "When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."
