"We had good conversations, substantive conversations that involved deep complex challenges," Pompeo said about his two meetings with the North Korean leader who is known for assassinating rivals and family members, and running prison camps throughout his country. 
Pompeo had met previously with Kim while CIA director, flying secretly to North Korea over the Easter weekend to discuss the possibility of a summit meeting with President Donald Trump and negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program. 
"They were good conversations. Our conversations were warm, we were each representing our two countries" and working to share an understanding of their objectives were, Pompeo said. "We talked about the fact that America has often in history had adversaries that we are now close partners with."
"The right path"
If Kim "chooses the right path," Pompeo said, "there is a future brimming with peace and prosperity for the ... North Korean people. America's track record of support for the Korean people is second to none. If North Korea takes bold action to quickly denuclearize the United States is prepared to work with North Korea to achieve prosperity on the par with our South Korean friends."
Pompeo spoke alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, who is in Washington to get a briefing on the top US diplomat's meetings and to prepare for a May 22 summit meeting between Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. 
Pompeo said that that any agreement with North Korea will have to include a "robust verification program" to ensure that Pyongyang complies, adding that the Trump administration was focused on making sure "we didn't end up where we were before" in their talks with North Korea. 
Pompeo and other US officials have repeatedly said they are seeking North Korea's permanent verifiable denuclearization, while North Korean officials have said that they have already achieved their nuclear objectives. 
When asked to define what he meant by permanent, verifiable denuclearization, Pompeo said, "I'm not sure how to define it fully, it's pretty clear what that means ... how to ensure North Korea doesn't possess the capacity to threaten the world."
"It will require a robust verification program and one that we will undertake with partners around the world," Pompeo added. 
Pompeo said that all three countries -- the US, South Korea and North Korea -- share the same vision for future of the Korean peninsula. "I am confident we have a shared understanding of the outcome that the leaders want," Pompeo said, "certainly President Trump and Chairman Kim and I think President Moon as well."
"I think we have a shared vision for what we hope, when this process is completed, the Korean peninsula looks like, I think we have a good understanding and I think there's complete agreement of what the ultimate objectives are," Pompeo said, adding that, "we began to work through the modalities of how we achieve that."</p><a href=http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/x3cQSFi-Kmg/index.html class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>Pompeo's 13 hours in North Korea</h5><p class=card-text>He was headed to Pyongyang, he told the only two reporters allowed on the trip, to nail down the agenda that President Donald Trump and Korean leader Kim Jong Un would tackle when they convene for their historic summit. Pompeo didn't know exactly who he'd meet, he said. 
But he added that he would raise the issue of three Americans detained in North Korea, cautioning that he had no commitment for their release. 
I hope North Korea "will do the right thing," he said. "We've been asking for the release of these detainees for 17 months," he added. "We'll talk about it again. It'd be a great gesture if they'd agree to do so." 
Over the next day and a half of long meetings, red wine toasts and negotiations in the isolated North Korean capital, the newly minted secretary of state would score the most dramatic foreign-policy victory of the Trump administration, securing the release of the three men and bringing them back to American soil.
This account is based on pool reports by the reporters from The Associated Press and The Washington Post who accompanied Pompeo and were able to observe and report on events as they unfolded. 
While the administration had been signaling the release of 
the prisoners for days beforehand, the trip had been a closely held secret until Trump announced during remarks from the White House Diplomatic Room on Tuesday that he'd dispatched his top diplomat. 

Pompeo traveled with a small team that included Brian Hook, the State Department's head of policy planning; Matt Pottinger of the National Security Council; Lisa Kenna of the executive secretariat; and Heather Nauert, the State Department's acting undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs.
Pompeo's jet, a C-32A known as the "Big Plane," lifted off from Andrews at about 9:30 p.m. on Monday, then refueled at Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage, Alaska, before taking off again for Japan. 
It was nearly 7 p.m. on Tuesday in Washington -- almost 24 hours after Pompeo had left Andrews -- when the former CIA director landed in Pyongyang. 
Displays of power
On the tarmac, Pompeo was greeted by several officials, including the vice chairman of the Party Central Committee, Kim Yong Chol, the official in charge of relations between North and South Korea, and Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong. 
Pompeo stepped into a black Mercedes limousine, and his team and the reporters piled into a bus and Chevrolet vans for the 23-kilometer ride -- a little over 14 miles -- to the capital city. 
The American motorcade passed farmland, housing blocks and morning commuters, most of whom were walking or biking on a paved path on the side of the road. Matt Lee of The Associated Press, who had covered then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's trip to North Korea during the Clinton administration's attempt to negotiate with the isolated regime, noted that the city had been considerably built up since that visit in 2000. 
The motorcade's winding route took the Americans past the city's largest and most prominent displays of power, including a library and research center famous for its huge statues of former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and various monuments celebrating the glory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, including Pyongyang's own version of Paris' Arc de Triomphe.
Their destination was the Koryo Hotel, the main lodging for foreigners, where portions of Albright's delegation had stayed 18 years ago. 
Once they arrived, Pompeo met for about an hour with Kim Yong Chol, discussing the 
Trump-Kim summit and Pompeo's schedule, before Kim hosted a luncheon on the hotel's 39th floor, where he formally welcomed the Americans.

Over a table arrayed with dishes of poached fish and duck served with red wine, Kim raised the possibility of better relations and offered some pointed political remarks.
"You have visited Pyongyang at such a good time, at such a warm and lovely spring, and a good atmosphere has been established between North and South, so everything is going well in Pyongyang now," the North Korean official said. 
Kim then told the Americans that "we have perfected our nuclear capability," adding that "this is not the result of sanctions that have been imposed from outside."
"It is our policy to concentrate all efforts into economic progress in country," Kim said before making an appeal laced with flattery.
"I hope the United States also will be happy with our success," he said. "I have high expectations the US will play a very big role in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula." 
'For decades, we have been adversaries'
He then toasted Pompeo, who stood and returned the salutation. The group with him, Pompeo said, was "equally committed to working with you to achieve exactly" that: peace on the peninsula.
"For decades, we have been adversaries," the top US diplomat continued. He said he hoped "that we can work together to resolve this conflict, take away threats to the world and make your country have all the opportunities your people so richly deserve." 
"There are many challenges along the way," Pompeo allowed. "But you have been a great partner in working to make sure our two leaders will have a summit that is successful."
Not long afterward, Pompeo was given about an hour's notice that he would be granted an audience with Kim Jong Un. They met that afternoon for about 90 minutes to discuss plans for the summit. The reporters were not allowed to attend, but on Pompeo's return to the hotel, they asked whether there was good news about the detainees. 
The Americans, Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak-song and Kim Sang Duk, also known as Tony Kim, had been held in North Korea for at least a year.

Tony Kim and Kim Hak-song were arrested in April and May of 2017, accused of carrying out "hostile acts" against the regime. Both worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, which bills itself as the only privately run university in the North Korean capital.
Kim Dong Chul had been in North Korean custody since before Trump was elected, arrested in 2015 and accused of spying for South Korea. 
Pompeo responded to the reporters' question wordlessly, simply crossing his fingers.
Soon after his audience with the North Korean leader, though, an official arrived at the Koryo Hotel with news: Kim Jong Un was releasing the Americans. 
"
We're granting amnesty to the three detained Americans," the North Korean emissary told Pompeo, according to a US official. "We issued the order to grant immediate amnesty to the detainees."

"That's great," Pompeo replied.
'This was a hard decision'
"It should be a very brief ceremony," the North Korean said, noting that the "ceremony" was more like a legal process. "You should make care that they do not make the same mistakes again," the North Korean said in closing, according to the US official. "This was a hard decision."
The detainees would be released that night at 7 local time, Pompeo was told.
Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Carl Risch, accompanied by a doctor, went to another hotel to get the men. At 7:45 p.m. in Pyongyang -- 6:45 a.m. in Washington -- Risch, the doctor and the detainees walked out of the hotel and headed to Pyongyang International Airport.
Forty minutes later, the detainees and their escorts arrived at the airport, where they met with the secretary and his team and boarded Pompeo's plane. The three detainees walked without assistance from the van that had brought them from custody, and were seated with medical personnel in the middle section of the plane, which had been curtained off.
At 8:42 p.m. local time, just under an hour after the detainees were released from the hotel, Pompeo's C-32A lifted off from the North Korean runway bound for the US military's Yokota Air Base in Japan. 
Pompeo, flush from the victory, came to the back of the plane to speak to the reporters. "It was a long day. It was a long day," he said as they flew back to Japan. "But there were no moments where I felt like we were going to be anything but successful in the day." 
'A long day... but worth the time'
He noted that there were "no glitches, but we were on the -- what, 13 hours maybe on the ground, something like that from start to finish? So a long day.  A long day for our counterparts, the North Korean team, as well. But worth the time and effort, and I think very productive."
Having the three Americans on the plane, he said, was "incredibly exciting." The men seemed to be in good health, Pompeo told the reporters: "All indications are at this point that their health is as good as could be given that they've been held." 
Pompeo wouldn't share what the detainees' first words to him were. "I just want to respect their privacy," he said. But he confessed that when they noted they had left North Korean airspace, "we were all thrilled when we knew we were outside of that space." 
The secretary told the reporters that once they were in Japan, they'd be met by another plane with "even more robust medical capabilities" in the event the detainees needed it. "Hopefully in the next couple of hours a more complete readout of their complete conditions," Pompeo said.
He touched briefly on his conversation with Kim Jong Un about preparing for the summit, saying it had been "good and lengthy." The White House would soon announce the date, time and location, he said. 
"That part is behind us for sure, and we had a chance to talk substantively about what we intend to be on the agenda, and also how we're going to begin to coordinate in the days ahead. ... Both sides are confident that we will set the conditions for a successful meeting between the two leaders," Pompeo said. 
He said he felt that Kim "is trying to set good conditions for the summit."
Shortly before Pompeo and his team landed in Japan, at 8:30 a.m. in Washington, Trump jubilantly tweeted that the secretary "is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting." 
At Yokota Air Base in Japan, the detainees were transferred to a separate, waiting plane, and both planes took off for the 10-hour flight to Anchorage, where they would refuel. Many on Pompeo's plane, exhausted, were already asleep before it took off.
The prisoners' plane touched down in Anchorage at 1:21 p.m. local time Wednesday and took off within the hour, with an arrival time at Andrews set for the wee hours of Thursday morning. On the plane to Yokota, Pompeo told the reporters that Trump was planning to be at Andrews Air Force Base to meet the detainees when they arrived.  
One of the reporters asked Pompeo if there had been a moment when he gave himself "a little pat on the back" for securing the Americans' release. 
"Still have work to do," Pompeo answered. "I'm thrilled that we have them back. I'm happy that actually President Trump set the conditions for this to happen, and I'm thrilled with that. But there's still a lot of work to do to achieve our ultimate goal."

Trump excoriated Iran for its "destabilizing activities" in the region in his remarks from the White House Diplomatic Room, including Tehran's "support for terrorism," 
its "nuclear threat" as well as the dangers posed by its ballistic missile program. And while he warned that, "America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail," he did not mention the Americans being held in Iran.

"These people are being lost in the shuffle," Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter imprisoned in Iran for about 18 months, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer after Trump announced his decision. Rezaian added that he didn't see "any way out now" for those still behind bars in Iran. 
US officials estimate there are about six Americans being held in Iran, though experts on the country say the number is probably higher, as some families choose not to publicize their loved ones' situation in the hope that a quiet approach will make for a quicker release. 
The numbers include four Iranian-Americans and one Chinese-American graduate student accused of various crimes, including "collaborating with enemy states" and spying. They include businessman Morad Tahbaz, gallery owner Karan Vafadari, 
Baquer and Siamak Namazi, a father and son, and Xiyue Wang, a Princeton PhD candidate.  

Perhaps the highest profile American held by Iran is Robert Alan Levinson, a retired FBI agent working for the CIA, who disappeared while on Kish Island in Iran in 2007.    
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told CNN in a 2014 interview that he had not seen evidence that proves Levinson was even in Iran. In April, Zarif suggested during an interview with CBS' Face the Nation that Iran would be open to a prisoner swap if Trump showed Iran more respect and stopped making references to regime change. 
A swap "is a possibility, certainly from a humanitarian perspective, but, but it requires a change of attitude," Zarif said, "and a change of language."
There's no evidence that Trump will offer that kind of change any time soon, and former officials who have dealt with Iran were pessimistic about the prospects for Americans held in the country. 
Trump's decision to leave the deal "increases the risks for those loved ones and it increases the likelihood that we will not see them come home anytime soon," said Wendy Sherman, a former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs who helped negotiate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the Iran deal is formally known. 
"It is absolutely incumbent upon our government to do everything we can to make sure Americans are not left behind, and that we bring the Americans who are detained there home, that we find Robert Levinson and bring him home," Sherman said during a call with reporters arranged by the group National Security Action.  
She noted that it has been "years that the Levinson family has been struggling with not knowing where Bob is, and I think it will be particularly painful to see the 
detained in North Korea come home without North Korea really having done anything, where Iran has fully complied with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action since January of 2016, nearly 2 years of full compliance. And yet Americans are still stuck."

Moderates in Iran who might have wanted to help Americans get home now have little political power to make that happen, Sherman noted, as now it would look like they were making concessions to the US without getting anything in return, just as Trump is vilifying the country. 
Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, noted that previous detainee releases from Iran came about because of efforts by another country or direct talks between Iran and the US. He noted that the only regular channel of communication between Tehran and Washington - quarterly talks associated with the JCPOA - will no longer take place now that the US has pulled out of the deal.
"The only regular channel that existed between the US and Iran was the JCPOA," Parsi said. "Now that the US has violated that and pulled out of it, it's difficult to see how we're going to get those Americans out."
"We're doing our best"
As 
Pompeo flew from North Korea to Japan with the three Korean-American detainees on Wednesday, he was asked about the perception some might have that the US was leaving some Americans behind while picking others. 

"We're doing our best to get them all back," Pompeo said. "There are Americans being held in several places, right. There are Americans detained in Syria as well. When I was the CIA director, I could see the State Department and all of the United States Government was focused on getting every one of those Americans returned wherever they were."
Reporters in Washington asked a senior State Department official a similar question Tuesday, pushing for an answer on what the administration will do to help those detained in Iran. 
"Let me offer that the security and safety of Americans is our top priority," the official said. The official had "just come" from a White House call with the family of one of the Americans detained in Iran. "They were asking exactly the same things," the official said.   
"I don't want to - this is going to be unsatisfying to you - I don't want to get into it," the official said. "That's conversations we're having with a number of parties to try and resolve those cases, but - so I'm leery.  I'm leery about getting too much into that, and I know that's unsatisfying, so I'm sorry."</p><a href=http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/t4ET65JoFOg/index.html class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>Saudi Arabia set to pursue nuclear weapons if Iran restarts program</h5><p class=card-text>Asked what his country will do if Iran restarts its nuclear program, Adel Al-Jubeir told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that "we will do whatever it takes to protect our people. We have made it very clear that if Iran acquires a nuclear capability we will do everything we can to do the same." 
Asked to clarify whether that means the kingdom will work to acquire its own nuclear capability, al-Jubeir said, "That's what we mean." He also praised President Donald Trump's announcement Tuesday that the US was quitting the Iran nuclear deal. 
"We believe the nuclear deal was flawed," al-Jubeir said, criticizing portions of the agreement that expire and the fact that its scope is limited to nuclear issues. "We believe the deal does not deal with Iran's ballistic missile program nor does it deal with Iran's support for terrorism."
While Trump's decision has pleased allies in Israel and Persian Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, it pits the US against its closest European allies, leaves the future of Tehran's nuclear ambitions in question and raises the prospects of a regional arms race.
"As long as Iran was constrained and closely inspected, the Saudis could afford to put off their nuclear ambitions," Mark Fitzpatrick, executive director of the American branch of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said on Tuesday. 
"Now their calculations change. ... Trump's rejection of the diplomatic solution to the Iran nuclear crisis undermines multilateral diplomacy and the very underpinnings of the nuclear order. It gives a new writ to nuclear lawlessness, since Iran's having abided by the agreed rules will be proven to have been in vain."
Energy-rich Saudi Arabia, a fierce regional foe of Iran's, is already seeking US help in starting a nuclear program of its own, giving rise to concerns that it might be trying to compete with Iran's nuclear program and create its own nuclear weapons program. 
The White House has been pursuing a deal to sell nuclear reactors to Riyadh despite the kingdom's reluctance to accept stringent restrictions against nuclear proliferation, including uranium enrichment. 
Under its new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom has begun pursuing a markedly more aggressive foreign policy designed in large part to counter Tehran, and has quietly aligned itself more closely with Israel. 
Bin Salman has developed close relations with the Trump White House, courting the President's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, in particular. 
During a visit to Washington, bin Salman told CBS that it wanted the program for peaceful purposes, despite its reluctance to accept constraints on uranium enrichment, a step in the production of nuclear weapons. 
"Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible," bin Salman said.</p><a href=http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/M5rzoKYMNtI/index.html class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>Boris Johnson takes to Fox News in last-ditch effort to save Iran deal</h5><p class=card-text>UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson arrived in Washington on a full court press in defense of the Iran nuclear deal, taking to the airwaves on Fox News and meeting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to not just defend the agreement but also warn against the US pursuing a military option against Tehran.

President Donald Trump, long hostile to the Iran deal, has hinted that he will walk away from it. On Monday he tweeted that he would be announcing his decision at 2 p.m. ET on Tuesday and earlier in the day in another tweet he dismissed the 2015 pact as a "mess."

Appearing on one of the President's favorite TV programs, "Fox & Friends," Johnson asked what the US plan would be if Trump decides to opt out. Many in Washington wonder about the possibility of a military strike against Tehran -- particularly with the recent appointment of national security adviser John Bolton, a hawk on Iran.

"Are we seriously saying that we will bomb those facilities ... is that really a realistic possibility?" Johnson asked.

Johnson also warned in the interview about the consequences of scrapping the deal negotiated by the US, UK, France, Germany, China, Russia and the European Union. It offered Iran nuclear-related sanctions relief in exchange for strict curbs on its nuclear program, which would no longer apply if Iran decides to leave the deal as well.

"If they do get a nuclear weapon, you're going to get an arms race in the Middle East," Johnson said. "You're going to have the Saudis wanting one, the Egyptians wanting one, the Emiratis. It's already a very, very dangerous state at the moment, we don't want to go down that road. There doesn't seem to me at the moment to be a viable military solution."

'swagger' and security</h5><p class=card-text>Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday that the safety of State Department diplomats and their families will be a top priority for him as he paid his respects to fallen foreign service officers and the culture of sacrifice that defines the agency.

"I promise I'm going to do everything I can to keep every one of our team members safe," he said at a ceremony for foreign service officers who died in the line of duty, their names engraved on the wall behind him.

Pompeo said that even before he was confirmed by the Senate, he was thinking about safety.

"The very first briefing I received after I was nominated was on the issue of security," the new secretary said Friday. "I take this mission incredibly seriously."

But the issue of safety is fraught, both for the secretary and the agency he now leads.

Pompeo made his mark as a lawmaker on the House select investigative committee probing the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that led to the deaths of four Americans.

During that time, he was a vocal critic of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's leadership of the State Department, rebuking her and others in the Obama administration for failing to better protect its personnel and respond to the attack as it unfolded.

Many in the diplomatic community believe the House Select Committee on Benghazi's investigation led to a culture of greater risk aversion in the agency, which has since hampered its efforts. Diplomats in certain posts are forbidden from traveling outside the embassy without guards, curbing their ability to connect with people. In some countries, they're forbidden from entering certain areas for security reasons.

That's an issue Pompeo will have to grapple with as he makes a call for diplomats to regain their "swagger" and do their jobs "in every corner of the world," as part of President Donald Trump's "muscular diplomacy."

At his formal swearing-in ceremony at the State Department on Tuesday, Pompeo said that "we need our men and women out at the front lines, executing American diplomacy with great vigor and energy, and to represent the finest nation in the history of civilization. We should be proud of that, and I'm counting on you all to help communicate in every corner of the world."

But "swagger" might be hard to align with an emphasis on security, observers point out.

Ambassador Ronald Neumann, president of the American Academy of Diplomacy, says the select committee's investigation did contribute to a culture of risk aversion at the State Department that continues to this day.

And yet Pompeo felt the committee's work was "incomplete," wrote Derek Chollet, a former Pentagon official, and Ben Fishman, former North Africa director for the National Security Council. "So he co-authored fifty more pages of 'additional views' " about the attack, the two write.

"By persistently attacking the State Department and questioning its mission, the committee undermined the legitimacy of the institution and the competence of its personnel," Chollet and Fishman wrote in Foreign Policy magazine. "The result is a diplomatic corps that is bruised, demoralized, and risk-averse."

The State Department couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Neumann noted the irony, saying that aversion to risk is "one of the challenges he's going to have to tackle if he wants to get people out to do their job."

That said, Neumann and others stress that the diplomatic community is looking forward to having Pompeo at the helm and wants to focus on the future as it recovers from a year of morale-busting hiring freezes and proposed budget cuts.

"After the last year with [former Secretary of State Rex] Tillerson, people are a lot more focused on rebuilding the State Department and stopping the beating than they are looking back to Benghazi," Neumann told CNN, noting that Pompeo is "saying the right things" to staff so far.

"I think generally people are looking forward to having him there overall," he added.

Neumann wants to see Pompeo focus on restaffing the agency and elevating experienced career professionals to top-tier jobs, along with political appointees. The State Department is signaling that Pompeo wants to move quickly to fill vacant positions.

"The secretary has acknowledged and highlighted the importance of filling vacant positions," spokesman Heather Nauert said Wednesday. "As many of you know, we have a lot of them, and so he will be working very hard in filling up those positions."

Several State Department officials say the newly minted secretary is being well-received among the agency rank-and-file. They point to Pompeo's remarks to State employees and at his swearing-in ceremony, his emphasis on his respect for the department and his declared intention to be accessible and a good listener.

And Pompeo's first official act as secretary -- lifting a hiring freeze on family members of overseas diplomats, imposed by Tillerson -- was a hugely popular move. He announced the decision in an email to State Department employees, obtained by CNN, in which he addressed them as "team" and signed off as "Mike."</p><a href=http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/ZTTXQ7hCeAU/index.html class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>Pompeo promises to restore State Department's 'swagger'</h5><p class=card-text>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, already five days into his new job, arrived at the State Department for the first time since being confirmed Tuesday to polite applause.

Pompeo told hundreds gathered in the department's formal entrance that he was there to pump new life back into the oldest US Cabinet agency, at a time when the US faces serious foreign policy challenges in Asia and the Middle East.

"My mission is to lead you," Pompeo said, adding that he was humbled to take up the position. "America can't achieve its objectives, absent you all," he told the crowd. "I am looking forward to helping you all achieve that."


    "I know we will deliver for this President and this country," Pompeo said. He told the crowd that President Donald Trump and some of his Cabinet members would visit the State Department Wednesday to formally swear him in.

Standing above the crowd on a staircase, he joked that, "one of my most important rules is don't talk down to people, so I'll talk to you all up here."


    The 70th top diplomat's debut at his agency was delayed because he launched himself into his first international trip immediately after being sworn in, traveling to Belgium and the Middle East to shore up key alliances and discuss the Iran nuclear deal.


    Pompeo is inheriting a badly bruised agency after the administration under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson moved to cut the budget by about 30% and left dozens of senior positions unfilled, essentially handicapping a central part of the national security apparatus.

His goal, he has said, it to return some "swagger" to the department. Asked what his first steps will be to turn things around, Pompeo talked about meeting some State Department diplomats while on the trip and offered promises, not specifics.

"They may have been demoralized, but they seemed in good spirits," Pompeo said Friday at a press conference in Brussels. "They are hopeful that the State Department will get its swagger back, that we will be out doing the things that they came onboard at the State Department to do: to be professional, to deliver diplomacy, American diplomacy around the world."

"My mission set," Pompeo added, "is to build that esprit and get the team on the field so that we can effectuate American diplomacy. I know that the State Department and the people there can do that."</p><a href=https://santamariatimes.com/video/featured/pompeo-promises-to-restore-state-department-s-swagger/article_7b447607-ff40-5d1b-8ae9-69723d295f96.html class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div><div class="card margin10"><div class=card-body><h5 class=card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted>Pompeo promises to restore State Department's 'swagger'</h5><p class=card-text>Pompeo told hundreds gathered in the department's formal entrance that he was there to pump new life back into the oldest US Cabinet agency, at a time when the US faces serious foreign policy challenges in Asia and the Middle East.

Pompeo, on his first trip as the top US diplomat, also said the US and NATO were prepared to push back hard against Russia and congratulated South Korea and North Korea on their historic agreement to set aside their conflict and cooperate on denuclearizing their shared peninsula.

Until that happens, though, Pompeo warned that the "maximum pressure campaign" to exert financial and diplomatic pressure on North Korea will continue. Pompeo, who met secretly with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said he got the sense that Kim was serious about negotiations.

"I don't want to say anything about the meeting itself," Pompeo said, before adding that, "yes, I did get a sense that he was serious."

US and Israeli officials intensify the drumbeat against Iran "The economic pressure that has been put in place by this global effort that President Trump has led has led him to believe that it is in his best interests to come to the table and talk about de-nuclearization," Pompeo said. But he cautioned that history has shown the North Koreans to be wily negotiators and that many agreements in the past have been hailed, only to disintegrate. "There is a lot of history here where promises have been made, hopes have been raised and then dashed," he said. Trump is set to meet Kim for a summit, possibly in May. "In the event it fails," Pompeo said, "respectfully President Trump will walk away and the pressure will remain, but in the event we reach a resolution, it would be a wonderful thing for the world." Pompeo will go from Brussels, where he has been meeting with NATO allies and focusing primarily on the threat from Russia, to the Middle East, where Iran will likely be the major point of discussion. Trump has consistently denigrated the deal, calling it "insane" during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron. His chief complaints are that the deal doesn't cover Iran's ballistic missile program or its regional activities, and that some clauses expire. The deal bars Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon regardless of the so-called "sunset clauses." Trump set a May 12 deadline for the US and Europe to address issues that aren't covered in the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. May 12 is the date by which Trump has to decide whether or not to continue waiving sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the Iran deal. Under US law, the President has to recertify the agreement every few months. Macron concedes it's going to take way more work to keep Trump in the Iran nuclear deal EU nations continue to strongly support the deal and have been working with US negotiators to find ways to address Trump's complaints, but during Macron's visit it seemed increasingly clear that the President will walk away and push for some other approach. Sources familiar with Trump's conversations with Macron suggest that a separate agreement is under discussion that has the force of a treaty that will exist alongside the original nuclear deal. Pompeo said that "there has been no decision made" yet and the "team is working." He added that during his Mideast stops he would be talking about Trump's concerns and "about ways to potentially address those shortcomings."</p><a href=http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/B2fKltaPVEA/index.html class=card-link>Read More</a></div></div>
